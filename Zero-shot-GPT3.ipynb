The following are definitions and justifications for Premium Class Travel.\\nYou may request the use of First-Class airline accommodations only when ED specifically authorizes/approves your use of such accommodations, for the reasons given as follows:\\n(a) No coach or business-class accommodations are reasonably available. “Reasonably available” means available on an airline that is scheduled to leave within 24 hours of your proposed departure time, or scheduled to arrive within 24 hours of your proposed arrival time.\\n(b) When use of first-class is necessary to accommodate a disability or other special need. A disability must be substantiated in writing by a competent medical authority. A special need must be substantiated in writing. If you are authorized to have an attendant (to accommodate your special needs) accompany you, you may be authorized for the attendant to use first-class accommodations if you require the attendant’s services en route.\\n(c) When exceptional security circumstances require first-class travel. Exceptional security circumstances include, but are not limited to:\\n(1) Use of other than first-class accommodations would endanger your life or Government property;\\n(2) You are an agent on protective detail and you are accompanying an individual authorized to use first-class accommodations; or\\n(3) You are a courier or control officer accompanying controlled pouches or packages.\\n(d) When required because of agency mission.*\\n*ED will not authorize premium class travel based on mission criteria alone. All requests must meet additional criteria for premium class travel.\\nNote: You may upgrade to first-class at your personal expense, including through redemption of frequent flyer benefits. This must be done outside of ED’s Travel Management Center, directly with the specific airline. Any changes relating to upgrades must be done after the ‘official’ ticket has been issued through ED’s Travel Management Center.\\nBusiness Class accommodations will only be approved for the following reasons:\\nRegularly scheduled flights between origin/destination points (including connecting points) provide only first-class and business- class accommodations and you certify such on your authorization; or\\nNo space is available in coach-class accommodations in time to accomplish the mission, which is urgent and cannot be postponed; or\\nWhen use of business-class accommodations is necessary to accommodate your disability or other special need. Disability must be substantiated in writing by a competent medical authority. Special need must be substantiated in writing. If you are authorized to have an attendant (to accommodate your special needs) accompany you, you may be authorized for the attendant to use business-class accommodations if you require the attendant’s services en route; or\\nSecurity purposes or exceptional circumstances with the use of business-class accommodations essential to the successful performance of the agency’s mission; or\\nCoach-class accommodations on an authorized/approved foreign air carrier do not provide adequate sanitation or health standards; or\\nThe use results in an overall cost savings to the Government by avoiding additional subsistence costs, overtime, or lost productive time while awaiting coach-class accommodations; or\\nYour transportation costs are paid in full through agency acceptance of payment from a non-federal source in accordance with the FTR; or\\nWhere the origin and/or destination are Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS), and the scheduled flight time, including stopovers and change of planes, is in excess of 14 hours (in this instance you will not be eligible for a rest stop en route or a rest period upon arrival at your duty site); or\\nWhen required because of agency mission.*\\n*ED will not authorize premium class travel based on mission criteria alone.

This must be done outside of ED’s Travel Management Center, directly with the specific airline. Any changes relating to upgrades must be done after the ‘official’ ticket has been issued through ED’s Travel Management Center.\\nPremium class travel will not be authorized for either temporary duty or permanent change of station (relocation) when the employee is not required to report to duty the following day. This is considered a rest stop. ED does not authorize rest stops in support of ED travel.\\nED will not authorize premium class travel based on mission criteria alone. All requests must meet additional criteria for premium class travel.\\nBlanket annual certifications for disabilities or special needs will not be allowed. Each trip must be approved on a case-by-case basis and have all required documentation provided.\\nFrequent Flyer/ Bonus Programs and Other Promotional Materials\\nTravelers are encouraged to enroll in frequent flyer traveler programs offered by various common carriers, hotel/motel chains and automobile rental companies.\\nThe use of contract carriers has precedence and must be used when available. Employees may not choose a carrier just because he/she is a member of the carrier’s frequent flyer program.\\nUse of Benefits\\nThe employee may retain benefits obtained through official travel (frequent flyer miles, bonus flights, reduced fare coupons, cash, gifts, credit toward future free or reduced costs of services or goods, etc.). The FTR allows travelers to retain and make personal use of promotional items earned while on official Government travel if the promotional item is obtained under the same terms as those offered to the general public and at no additional cost to the Government. If the employee voluntarily gives up a seat on an airline, the employee may keep the compensation as long as it doesn't interfere with official duties, no additional expense to the Government is involved, and leave is taken when required.\\nA traveler who receives compensation from an airline for being denied a reserved seat must provide any payment received for liquidated damages to ED.\\nNote: Only the airlines themselves (NOT the TMC) can make reservations when frequent flyer miles are “cashed in.”\\n\": '',\n",
       " 'Travel Gainsharing Program\\nIf lodging expenses are below the maximum allowable lodging rate for the travel destination, the traveler is entitled to one-half the amount ED saves after a cumulative savings of $400. If the traveler stays with a friend or relative and has no lodging expenses, he/she will receive one-half the lodging rate for that particular city after a cumulative savings of $400. If the traveler is enrolled in a frequent flyer program and saves ED the cost of a common carrier ticket, he/she is entitled to one-half the savings from receiving the award after a cumulative savings of $400. Employees must fill out the appropriate savings form (which can be obtained in Executive Offices) after returning from travel. Travelers must submit the savings form before the end of the fiscal year in which the trip(s) occurred; any forms received after the fiscal year will be denied. Further information and required forms for filing can be reviewed/downloaded on ConnectED, through the Travel Information link.\\nProcessing of Unused Airline Tickets\\nAll unused airline tickets should be returned by the traveler either prior to or at the time the Travel Voucher is submitted. For tickets purchased with the contractor issued travel charge card, the traveler is responsible for ensuring that the unused tickets are returned to the TMC and that a credit is issued to the contractor issued travel charge card for all unused tickets.\\nRental Cars (FTR §301- 10.400)\\nAuthorization Requirements\\nIf travel requires the use of a rental car, the employee must prepare a justification of the cost effectiveness of a rental vehicle over other methods of transportation. This justification must demonstrate the cost effectiveness of the rental car use and must be entered in the ‘Remarks’ field of the travel authorization. The electronic approval of the Travel Certifying Official on the Travel Authorization is sufficient approval for the use of the rental vehicle. Some Principal Offices may request rental car justification in writing prior to creating the Travel Authorization.\\nThe rental of cars and other vehicles is authorized when advantageous to the Government. Personal convenience is not adequate justification for rental of a vehicle.\\nContracted Rental Agents for Automobiles\\nA list of rental car agents may be obtained through ED’s TMC or by consulting DOD’s Surface Deployment and Distribution Command’s website.\\nAlways ask for the Government rate.\\nResponsibilities of Employees\\nEmployees, 18 years or older, who rent vehicles while on official travel, are\\nresponsible for:\\n• Providing proof of official travel;\\n• Using the vehicle for official purposes only;\\n• The safe operation of the vehicle;\\n• Possessing a valid driver’s license;\\n• Making an effort to return the car to the rental agency with a full tank of gas or pre-purchasing gas from the automobile rental company; and\\n• Using least costly cars (upgrading of car requires prior approval if increase in cost is involved).\\nEmployees using the vehicle for personal travel in conjunction with Official Travel should obtain a second rental agreement for such personal travel.\\nCar Pick-up and Return\\nUnder normal circumstances, employees should pick up the rental automobile on the first day of official travel and return it promptly when further use is no longer necessary. Some travel cases may warrant the rental automobile to be obtained on the last day of work or on a non-work day. Such cases should be discussed with a supervisor and travel approving official before obtaining the rental automobile.\\nGovernment Administration Rate Supplement (GARS)\\nGARS is an automatic fee that has been recently negotiated with the contracted rental car companies and the DOD that charges $5 per day for a Government rated rental car. GARS will reimburse the rental car companies for those costs incurred which are peculiar to doing business with the Government, including the application of the agreement terms and conditions on a worldwide basis, the rental of vehicles to employees under age 25, acceptance of properly licensed fellow Government employees on official business as additional drivers, and a guarantee of the maximum rates for at least 60 days. GARS will be paid by all renters and shall be listed separately on the rental documents. This is a reimbursable expense.\\nSteps to Take in Case of Repairs or an Accident\\n1. In case of breakdown, the renter should immediately notify the car rental company and request a replacement vehicle (if necessary) and instructions for the disposition of the disabled vehicle.\\n2. In case of an accident, the renter should notify the car rental company, notify the police, and obtain a police report for the company. If a police report is not available, the renter will be required to provide the car rental company with all the exchanged information from all parties involved in the accident/incident.\\n3. The renter is required to promptly notify the location from which the car was rented and complete a company accident report (if applicable).\\n4. Additionally, the renter should keep a record of the location and representative who assisted the renter for follow-up purposes.\\n': '',\n",
       " 'Damage Waiver and Insurance\\nInsurance is covered under the Government contract. Travelers are discouraged from buying additional insurance. Employees who buy additional insurance will not be reimbursed for this cost.\\nFor a rental automobile used for official travel and covered by the Government contract rental agreement, ED only permits transporting Government employees and other individuals who conduct official business on behalf of ED. The standard insurance included in the Government rental agreement does not provide coverage for unauthorized passengers who could be injured as a result of an accident.\\nIf a relative, dependent, or other unauthorized passenger accompanies an ED traveler on official duty, the automobile should be leased using a private rental agreement, and the traveler’s reimbursement will be limited to the cost of a similar rental agreement to the Government.\\nThe Government contract will cover the cost of damages due to an accident or burglary, including any deductible. However, if an employee was found to be driving recklessly, or in violation of traffic laws, the cost for damages may be the responsibility of the employee.\\nAny claims that arise as a result of personal property loss, injury or death attributable to the use of a rental car should be submitted with all supporting documentation (e.g., police reports, rental contract, etc.) to the Assistant General Counsel for Business and Administrative Law, Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW, LBJ, Room 6C106, Washington DC 20202-2110.\\nThere are times when a traveler gets a lower rate from a car rental company than what the TMC has quoted. However, the rates that are negotiated by the Government include Collision/Damage/Waiver (CDW) Insurance and several other benefits to the Federal traveler that he/she would not get on their own. Usually when a traveler gets a lower rate, the CDW insurance is not included because the traveler is covered by their own personal insurance. Consider what the Federal traveler receives under Insurance and Damage Liability when booking car rental reservations through the TMC: protection against liability for personal injury; death; and property damage from the use of the vehicle; personal injury/wrongful death limits of $100,000 for each person for each accident or event; $300,000 for all persons in each such accident or event; and property damage limits of $25,000 for each occurrence. In addition, the car rental company assumes the entire risk of loss of or damage to rental vehicle (including costs of towing, administrative costs, loss of use, and replacements) from any and every cause whatsoever, including, without limitation, casualty, collision, fire, malicious mischief, vandalism, tire damage, falling objects, overhead damage, glass breakage, strike, civil commotion, theft and mysterious disappearance, except where the loss or damage was caused by non adherence to rules set forth in the contract. Utilizing the Government contract eliminates these worries along with what happens in the event of an accident.\\nCost Reimbursement\\nIf the leasing company does not pay for gasoline, expenses should be itemized on the Travel Voucher with attached receipts, when the expenses exceed $75. For all other applicable costs in the maintenance of the vehicle, travelers will be reimbursed as long as the expenses are itemized on the Travel Voucher. All claims for rental cars must be supported by receipts.\\nGovernment Furnished Vehicles (GFV)\\nDefinition\\nGovernment Furnished Vehicles are:\\n• Vehicles owned by GSA and leased by ED;\\n• Vehicles leased commercially through agreements with car-leasing agencies; or\\n• Commercially rented vehicles in ED’s possession obtained through rental agreements.\\nUsage\\nGFVs are used for official travel purposes only, and may not be used for:\\n• Personal travel;\\n• Permanent Change of Duty Moves; or\\n• Transportation of “unofficial” persons.\\n': '',\n",
       " 'Government Furnished Vehicles (GFV)\\nMileage Reimbursement Rate\\nThe mileage rate for GFVs established by the GSA is calculated based on the current rate in the electronic travel system.\\nGFV Operators\\nA GFV may be operated by an ED employee who:\\n• Is authorized on a Travel Authorization to utilize a GFV;\\n• Is 18 years of age or older; and\\nPossesses a valid driver’s license from any State, DC, Puerto Rico, or U.S. Commonwealth.\\nAccidents and Insurance Claims\\nIf an ED employee is in an accident using a GFV, he/she:\\n• Shall not make admissions of guilt at the scene of an accident; • May be held responsible if a vehicle is damaged -\\no Because of abuse, negligence, misuse; or\\no While driving under the influence of alcohol or narcotics;\\n• Must immediately report the accident to his/her immediate supervisor, including any injuries that involve a workers compensation claim. If the employee is a bargaining unit employee, the supervisor should inform the employee of the right to Union representation;\\n• Must complete and sign an accident report on an SF-91, Motor Vehicle Accident Report; and\\nMust have witnesses, if any, complete and sign a witness statement on an SF-94, Statement of Witness.\\nGSA-owned vehicles are self-insured by the U.S Government.\\nPrivately owned vehicles (POV)\\nAuthorization Requirements\\nPOV transportation may be authorized when such travel is:\\n• Deemed advantageous to the Government and based on constructive cost comparison of other travel modes.\\nA personal preference of the traveler, provided that expenses for mileage reimbursement, per diem, and other expenses are limited to the constructive cost of using a common contract carrier.\\nExcess Travel Time Incurred\\nWhen using a POV because of personal preference, travelers must charge annual leave for any travel time (during work hours) in excess of normal travel time via common carrier. Any necessary annual leave must be pre- approved.\\nMileage Rates\\nMileage rates for POV are updated electronically in the electronic travel system.\\nMileage Rate Exceptions\\nExceptions to the POV mileage rates for automobiles are also updated electronically in the electronic travel system. For example, the mileage rate of using a POV in lieu of an available GFV is lower than that of a POV where a GFV is not available for use.\\nReimbursable Costs\\nA complete list of reimbursable costs is updated in the electronic travel system.\\n': '',\n",
       " 'Local Transportation\\nDefinition\\nTravel performed within a 35-mile radius of the employee’s official duty station is considered local travel and does not require a Travel Authorization. Local travel does not allow for the payment of per diem.\\nTravel within the local radius should be performed using the most advantageous and economical means to ED.\\nPublic Transportation Usage\\nSubways or buses should be used as appropriate for local transportation (for exceptions, see “taxis”). If available through the employee’s respective Principal Office, employees may use ED- owned subway fare cards for local travel on official Government business.\\nPublic Transportation Bulk Purchases\\nAs a cost-effective measure, offices may purchase a supply of public transportation fare cards in varying amounts for use by their employees when traveling locally on government business.\\nOffices must institute appropriate internal controls over the fare card to ensure proper use and accounting.\\nTaxis\\nAuthorization and Usage For Local Travel\\nTaxicabs may be used by ED employees when official business is performed. ED employees should attempt to secure airport limousine/shuttle service or public transportation whenever possible. The following is a list of examples where a taxi would be approved.\\n• If heavy or bulk materials are being carried by ED employees.\\n• If the ED employee is disabled.\\n• If the employee is dependent on public transportation for\\nofficially ordered work outside regular working hours, and the travel between the employee’s office and home is during hours of infrequently scheduled public transportation or darkness.\\nNote: The scenarios above are being provided as a guide only and are not inclusive of all instances where a taxi will be approved.\\nCost Reimbursement\\nTaxi reimbursement is based on normally established rates.\\nTips are allowed at rates up to fifteen (15) percent of the base fare.\\n': '',\n",
       " 'D. ED Sponsored Group and Conference Arrangements\\nDefinition\\nFor the purpose of making travel and conference arrangements, a group is defined as 10 or more persons traveling to a central location for a meeting, retreat, training activity, work activity, or any other gatherings that involves travel.\\nNo-Cost Services\\nED’s TMC will make the following group conference arrangements at no cost to ED:\\n• Airline reservations and ticketing for all conference participants;\\n• Locating conference and lodging facilities that will meet the requirements of the group;\\n• Lodging/conference reservations for each member of the group; and\\n• Reservations for meeting/classroom space, breakout space, meals, audio/visual equipment, and group transportation from the lodging facility to the conference facility, if necessary.\\nServices for A Fee\\nED’s TMC will make the following group conference arrangements at a cost (which must be determined in advance) to ED:\\n• On-site assistance at the conference facility;\\n• Pre-inspection of the conference facility; and\\n• Preparation of pamphlets or materials relating to the conference. (However, Government Printing and Binding Regulations must be followed and such materials should be procured through the Government Printing Office.) Materials relating to the location of and about the conference facility will be provided free of charge.\\nUse of Other Travel Sources\\nTravel or conference management services offered through the TMC at no cost must be used, and Principal Offices may not obtain these services through another source unless:\\n• The requesting office sends a cost comparison to the contracting officer demonstrating that using another source will be more cost effective;\\n• The requesting office sends a justification to the contracting officer showing that the TMC cannot provide services, or that the services cannot reasonably be segregated from other services not available through the TMC; or\\nThe services are available from an 8(a) firm (i.e., a business certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) as being 51% minority owned or operated) at a reasonable price and the contracting officer awards the contract through the 8(a) program.\\nTravel Arrangement Procedures\\nTo obtain airline tickets, hotel space, conference space, or other travel or conference management services through the\\nTMC, the following procedures must be followed:\\n• Select a coordinator within the Principal Office to manage the conference planning and arrangements with the TMC. The coordinator should notify the TMC as soon as possible (preferably 75 days in advance of the date) with the number and names of the participants, the method of payment for air travel, the city and preferred location for the conference.\\n• Do not make arrangements directly with the conference and lodging facilities without the assistance of the TMC.\\nDo not make air/land reservations without the assistance of the TMC.\\n• Use of a contractor, other than the TMC, requires a written justification and cost comparison. The justification should provide information on the use of a contractor for conference services, other than the TMC, that would be more advantageous to ED. Justification should be submitted to Director, Financial Management Policies and Administrative Programs Group, for approval.\\n• Groups with air-only arrangements, regardless of the size of the group, should be made through ED’s designated TMC.\\n• Groups of 10 or more requiring air and land arrangements should be booked through the TMC, Group Department Office.\\n• ED policy on selection of conference sites requires at least three sites to be considered for the location of a conference. Offices must document the alternative sites considered and explain the rationale used in the selection of the conference site.\\n• Offices are required to maintain records on selection of conference sites and attendees. As required by OMB Bulletin No. 93-11, the records should be available for review. Each Principal Office is responsible for maintaining these records.\\nPayment Procedures\\nPayment procedures for groups and conferences are as follows:\\n• Advise the TMC of the method of payment for common carrier tickets (Government issued Charge Card or CBA). A Purchase Card or Purchase Order may not be used for payment of common carrier tickets.\\n• All payments made to the conference facility must be made directly to the conference facility, not through the TMC.\\nIf the conference facility requires a “deposit,” this should be done using a purchase card or a purchase order issued directly to the facility. If a purchase order must be issued, note on the purchase order request that “ED’s TMC has secured these arrangements.” By making this notation this informs Contracts and Acquisitions Management (CAM) that competitive bidding is not necessary.\\n': '',\n",
       " 'Chapter IV: Per Diem\\nGeneral Rules\\nDefinition\\nPer diem is a daily allowance for expenses incurred by an employee on temporary duty travel based on Government-wide rates established by GSA for specific geographical locations.
