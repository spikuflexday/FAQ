"Responsibility of Traveler after Trip
After travel is complete, an approved Travel Expense Summary (Attachment B1) should be submitted to the Business Office (Attachment F). If the advance exceeded the actual expenses, a check made payable to Sweet Briar College should accompany the Travel Expense Summary. If expenses were greater than the advance, the College will reimburse the traveler the net amount due.26
A travel advance will be held as a receivable from the traveler until a supporting Travel Expense Summary is processed by the Business Office (Attachment F). A travel advance should be settled promptly (generally within 15 working days of the completion of the trip), and before other advances or reimbursements are requested.
Failure to Account for an Advance on a Timely Basis
An employee may have only one travel advance outstanding at any given time. Occasionally there will be a need for an advance while having an outstanding advance (i.e. team travel, foreign travel). Approval for an advance while one is outstanding (less than 15 days (again, 30 days is usually the turnaround time) is required from the Associate Vice President for Finance and Administration. Failure to account for a travel advance within 120 days will result in:
• suspending of travel advance privileges
• reporting the advance to the IRS on the traveler’s W-2
• withholding of taxes on the advance from the traveler’s paycheck • payroll deduction (within 60 days)
Once an unsettled advance has been added to the traveler’s W-2, it cannot be reversed even if settled.
Students with an outstanding advance will have the amount in excess of documented expenses charged directly to their student account.
All Travel Advances for travel during the current fiscal should be reconciled before June 30 in order to expense the travel amounts to the current fiscal year. Advances that are not settled before the fiscal year is closed will reduce the next fiscal year’s budget.
Processing Request for Travel Advance
Properly completed and approved Requests for Travel Advance forms should be forwarded to the Business Office no more than 10 days prior to travel. Incomplete forms will be returned to the individual approving the advance and will not be processed,
Visa Management Bankcard Services (Pcard) Business Travel Accident Insurance
Visa Management Bankcard Services, PCard, provides business travel (accidental death and dismemberment) accident insurance to faculty and staff when the associated travel (rental cars and taxis are excluded) is charged directly to the individual’s Sweet Briar College Pcard. This is additional travel insurance; there is no “coordination of benefits” with the Sweet Briar College Travel Accident Insurance Policy.
Check with Cindy P to see if this is still applicable.
Details regarding this coverage can be obtained by contacting the Director of Purchasing at 381-6136.
Baggage Coverage
Pcard provides insurance against the physical loss of baggage and other personal effects in excess of the amount payable by a Common Carrier responsible for the loss. This coverage provides up to $500 (per eligible person) for checked baggage and $1,250 (per eligible person) for baggage and certain personal effects “carried on” a Common Carrier (certain items (e.g., cameras, jewelry) are limited in coverage to a combined maximum of $250 per trip).Check with Cindy P to see if these amounts are still applicable/

"Chapter II – Travel Authorizations
General Requirements
Requirements for Travel Authorizations
Travel shall be authorized only when it is necessary to accomplish the purposes of ED’s mission in the most effective and economical manner. A Travel Authorization must be issued for all travel outside a 35-mile radius of the traveler’s official duty station. For information on travel within a 35-mile radius, see Chapter III, Making Travel Arrangements, Section C, Local Transportation.
Purpose of Travel Authorization
A Travel Authorization:
• Authorizes an employee to incur specific travel expenses; • Estimates expenses;
• Obligates funds; and
Covers employee for liability purposes.
Authorization Approvals
An ED Approving Official (Reviewer, Approver or Certifier) ensures that the travel complies with ED policies and the FTR; that the travel is conducted effectively and economically; and that funds are available to support the authorization.
Per Diem versus Actual Expense
Per diem should generally be authorized for all travel
beyond ED’s local travel radius. Actual lodging expense must be authorized in advance by the Director, Functional Applications Group (or his/her designee), who has been delegated the authority to perform this function, in those special circumstances when travel is to an unusually-expensive location and per diem is inadequate. See Chapter IV: Per Diem and Chapter V: Reimbursement for Actual Subsistence, of this Handbook, for additional information on per diem and actual subsistence.
Scheduling Travel
To the extent possible, employees and supervisors should plan and schedule travel during duty hours.
Overtime During Travel Hours
Overtime may be authorized for employees for hours in actual travel status outside of the employee’s regular tour of duty hours when the travel:
• Involves performance of actual work while traveling;
• Is incident to travel that involves the performance of work while
traveling; and
• Results from events that could not be scheduled or controlled administratively.
All overtime must be approved and authorized in advance through a memorandum, which must be approved by the individual traveler’s budgeting and approving official(s). See Personnel Manual Instruction (PMI) 550-3, Premium Pay, Attachment A, for more details.","What are the requirements for travel authorizations?

"Chapter II – Travel Authorizations
General Requirements
Compensatory Time Off for Time in Travel Status During Off-Duty Hours
Employees may receive compensatory time (comp time) off for travel for those hours spent in a travel status. Travel status includes only the time actually spent traveling between the official duty station and a temporary duty station, or between two temporary duty stations, and the usual waiting time that precedes or interrupts such travel. Additional guidance and examples are provided by the Memorandum for Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies, Compensatory Time Off for Travel and in PMI 550-4, Compensatory Time Off for Official Travel.
• This policy only applies to travel time that is not otherwise compensable as regular overtime/compensatory time.
• Compensatory time earned under these circumstances must be used within 26 pay periods.
• Employees leaving the agency’s employment may not be paid for unused compensatory time.
• Bi-weekly and per annum pay caps do not apply as long as the travel time is not otherwise compensable as regular overtime/compensatory time.
Within 30 days upon his/her return from official travel, the employee must complete and submit Attachment A in PMI 550-4, Compensatory Time Off for Official Travel, with a copy of the approved itinerary received for authorized travel to request compensatory time for travel. Supervisors will review and approve the employee’s request so the timekeeper can enter the appropriate amount of compensatory time for travel into the automated payroll system. A copy of the approved compensatory (“time”?) and flexsheet should be kept with the travel documentation in the event of a travel review/audit.
Employees who fail to submit their requests and appropriate supporting documentation for official travel within the required timeframe will not receive any credit for compensatory time for that travel.
Compensatory time for travel must be tracked and maintained separately from other types of compensatory time. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the compensatory time for travel is properly recorded before they certify the employee’s electronic time card for release.
Combining Personal and Official Travel
When a traveler wishes to combine personal and official travel, the Approving Officer (Reviewer, Approver or Certifier) needs to review the situation against policy guidelines. The general rule is that a traveler on official business may take annual leave in conjunction with the official trip. In all such cases, the per diem that the traveler is entitled to should be reviewed to ensure that the traveler pays for expenses incurred on leave. Travelers are entitled to per diem only during the time that they are on official business travel. If a traveler chooses an indirect route or an interrupted route as a matter of personal preference, then the Approving Officer should verify that the per diem allowed to the traveler does not exceed the amount allowed for uninterrupted travel by a direct route. The traveler will only be issued a ticket for official Government travel and must exchange it for a personal ticket. When a ticket becomes a personal ticket, the traveler will be personally liable for the cost of the ticket and any changes or cancellations to the ticket. Per diem will begin at the start of official ED travel and will end when the personal travel begins.","What are the rules of combining Personal and Official Travel?

"Traveler’s Responsibilities
An employee traveling on official business is expected to exercise the same care and reasonableness in incurring expenses that a prudent person would exercise if traveling on personal business. The traveler will limit expenses to those that are essential to the transaction of official business. Employees will be responsible for paying increased costs that result from personal preference. Employees must travel to their destination by the usually traveled route unless ED authorizes or approves a different route as officially necessary. In addition, ED has to find it in its best interest to authorize travel from a location other than the official duty station.
Personal convenience is not a reason for ED to alter the travel.
","What some responsibilities of a traveller during travel?

"
"Preparation of Travel Authorization
Each trip that an employee intends to take must have a travel authorization. A single travel authorization may contain multiple destinations as long as a single departure and return to the traveler's official duty station or authorized point occurs. Authorizations and payment of transportation expenses are limited to those expenses that result in the greatest advantage to the government (e.g. the costs that would be incurred for roundtrip travel between the official duty station and the TDY site). All travel authorizations must be created using ED’s electronic travel system. Please refer to E2 End User Manual, the electronic travel system end-user guide, for assistance. Note: ED has implemented an electronic travel system. Printed copies of completed travel authorizations are not an ED requirement. Employees may choose to print completed authorizations to carry with them for TDY assignments. Printed authorizations do not have to become part of the retained travel documentation.
Information Required
The following is required to prepare a Travel Authorization:
• Traveler’s Name and ID Number;
• Itinerary;
• Purpose of Travel;
• Estimated Costs;
• Accounting Data;
• Special Authorizations; and
Approval Stamp.
Assignment of Travel Authorization
The Travel Authorization Number is generated automatically in the electronic travel system. The first two positions of the travel authorization number designate the Principal Office organizational code and are followed by a sequential number (e.g., EL0000...).
Cost Estimation
Travelers must estimate total costs of the trip for obligation purposes. Estimated costs should include:
• Per diem, reduced, conference or actual subsistence lodging rates;
• Transportation costs through the use of a contracted common carrier; and
Other reimbursable costs (i.e. taxis, phone calls, etc.).
Accounting Classification Identification
The traveler or the traveler’s Principal Office must assign the
appropriate accounting data for obligating the funds.
Emergency Travel Procedures
There may be a need for emergency travel where authorizations have not been created and/or certified in the electronic travel system. Since the Travel Management Center (TMC) requires a travel authorization prior to the issuance of airline tickets, Executive Offices have established emergency travel procedures to manually create (verbal) authorizations for travelers who are unable to generate a system authorization in sufficient time prior to departure. Upon returning from the trip, the traveler will be required to complete the electronic authorization, referencing the emergency TA number in the Remarks Section. The electronic travel authorization must be completely routed (certified) prior to creating and processing a voucher. The traveler should contact the Principal Office's Executive Office for further details on this process.
Specific Authorization
When applicable, the following activities or expenditures must be specifically authorized in the Travel Authorization:
• Annual leave of 8 hours or more while in travel status;
• Auto rentals under GSA contract;
• Commercial car rentals;*
• Use of non-contract airline carrier;*
• Use of GSA auto;
• Travel by privately-owned vehicle (POV) in lieu of Common
Carrier;*
• Foreign travel;*
• First class accommodations;*
• Use of taxis;
• Pre-employment interview travel;
• Laundry on trips of 4 consecutive nights of lodging or more;
• Actual subsistence;*
• Acceptance of payment from a non-Federal source for travel
expenses (In-kind travel);*
• Use of a foreign air carrier;
• Use of reduced fares for group or charter arrangements;
• Use of extra-fare train service;*
• Travel by ship;
• Use of a Government aircraft;
• Payment of a reduced per diem rate;
• Travel expenses related to emergency travel;
• Transportation expenses related to threatened law
enforcement/investigative employees and members of their
families; or
Travel expenses related to attendance at a conference.","Can one travel authorization have multiple destinations?

"
"Preparation of Travel Authorization
Travel Authorization Approvals (Route Lists)
All travel authorizations are approved through an electronic routing process in the electronic travel system. The process begins with the electronic routing of the document after the end-user/traveler or the traveler’s group administrator has created it. After certification (or complete routing of the document), documents are chosen randomly to undergo a series of pre-audits prior to the datalinking process. ED travel auditors review those documents chosen through the random audit process for appropriateness and adherence to ED and Federal policies. If auditors identify issues/discrepancies, documents are electronically returned to the traveler for correction or justification. Any document returned to the traveler must begin the route process anew after the correction has been made.
Based on the route model that has been assigned to the traveler, the document then proceeds to the next level of approval, which is usually the employee's supervisor. The final step in the routing process is the Certifying Official. Once the authorization is certified, it will pass through a nightly interface into the accounting system creating an obligation in the general ledger. In addition, once the travel authorization has been certified, this then triggers the TMC to issue common carrier e-tickets within the designated two business day timeframe.
Delegation of Approving Authority
Authority to approve the Travel Authorization may be re-delegated to the lowest level of management that has responsibility for both program accomplishment and obligation or commitment of funds.
Travel Authorization Amendments
Travel Authorizations should be amended when:
• Dates of travel change (depart or return by two or more days);
• The travel location changes;
• Cost of trip is increased by 25% or more of the amount
authorized; or
• Mode of Transportation changes.","What is the process of approval for a Travel Authorization?

"Chapter III: Making Travel Arrangements
(FTR §301-50)
Travel Management Centers.  
Definition
Travel Management Centers (TMC) are travel agencies with Federal contracts to provide travel services to all Government employees conducting official travel. TMCs must be used to secure lodgings, rental cars, and purchase common carrier tickets for all official ED travel. A processing fee is charged for each ticketed transaction including cancellations that occur after a ticket has been issued. Travel reservations should be made via the TMC’s on-line booking engine, unless unusual circumstances prevent the use of on-line booking.
If a traveler does not meet one of the exceptions listed below, and books outside of the TMC, the traveler is responsible for any additional costs resulting from failure to use the TMC. Prior approval from the Executive Officer (EXO) must be received before securing common carrier reservations outside of the TMC.
Exceptions to using the TMC
• The primary reason travelers are required to use a TMC to book their lodging reservations is to ensure that the lodging property meets the Hotel/Motel Fire Safety Act. All lodging properties participating in the FedRooms Program must meet the Hotel/Motel Fire Safety Act. Therefore, a Federal traveler choosing to stay at one of these lodging properties may make the reservations directly with the lodging property, instead of using the TMC.
• TMCs can only reserve rooms at lodging properties that are in their system. If a lodging property is not listed in the TMC’s system, the traveler can make that lodging reservation outside of the TMC, as long as the lodging property is in compliance with the Hotel/Motel Fire Safety Act.
• TMCs cannot book lodging reservations for employees who are attending conferences/training where rooms have been blocked off by a third party other than the TMC. In these cases, the traveler would need to book the reservation outside the TMC.
In some cases, the TMC’s on-line booking systems can only book car rental reservations at airport locations. If a traveler needs to make car rental reservations at other than an airport location, the traveler can either call the TMC to make the reservation or call the car rental company directly.
Services Provided
TMCs provide a wide range of travel services, including:
• Reservations and ticketing for travel via common carriers (air, rail, bus, steamship);
• Reservations for rental cars;
• Hotel/motel reservations and arrangements for conference
facilities;
• Email notification of electronic common carrier tickets;
• Periodic management reports on travel activity;
Point of contact for ED officials when problems arise; and • Offers on Supersaver/Penalty fares.       
Use of Other Travel Agencies
No other travel agency may be used to purchase travel services for official government travel. Using travel agents other than the established TMC for ED is a violation of the TMC’s contract with the Federal Government and may subject the Government to a suit for damages for breach of contract. Use of other means may also result in a claim for reimbursement being denied. Only emergency situations allow for the purchase of tickets directly from a common carrier.
A traveler should immediately contact the TMC once he/she has notification of a trip cancellation. If reservations are cancelled before a ticket is issued there will be no fees charged. If reservations are cancelled after a ticket has been issued, the ticket issuing fee will be charged.
E-Ticket vs. Paper Ticket
ED encourages the use of E-tickets rather than paper tickets. Most airlines charge a processing fee for issuing paper tickets. This fee is only reimbursable if there is a justified reason for requesting a paper ticket.","What are Travel Management Centers?

"
"B. Selecting a Mode of Transportation
Modes of Transportation
Travelers should use the most direct or usually traveled route. Additional transportation costs incurred by an employee who elects for personal reasons to travel by an indirect route are the employee's responsibility. (See Chapter IV; Per Diem, Section D, Interruptions to Per Diem Entitlement, for additional information.)
ED travelers are required by law to use the most expeditious and cost- efficient means of transportation when on official travel. Usually, this will be a common carrier. Travelers must:
(a) Limit authorization and payment of transportation expenses to those expenses that result in the greatest advantage to the Government; and
(b) Ensure that travel is by the most expeditious means practicable.
Airlines are normally used for long distance travel since they usually result in the lowest overall cost. (Please note: Travelers must use city- pair fares and government contract carriers to accomplish their mission unless prior approval and justification have been given for non- contract use.)
When travelers have multiple (local) airport choices, travelers will need to request approval to fly from the higher cost airport if the total airfare cost differential exceeds $250. This approval must be obtained in advance of the trip from the traveler’s respective Principal Officer. If the cost is less than $250, no Principal Officer approval is required.
In addition, travelers can fly direct non-stop contract carrier service in lieu of connecting contract carrier flights provided that the cost differential does not exceed $250. Approval of requests exceeding the $250 threshold must be obtained in advance of the trip from the traveler’s respective Principal Officer. If the cost is less than $250, no Principal Officer approval is required.
Other means of transportation, such as bus, train, or use of privately owned vehicles (POVs) and the payment of mileage, may be authorized if it is determined to be advantageous and economical to ED. When the use of a POV results in trip costs that are in excess of the common carrier cost for the same trip, reimbursement and compensatory time calculations are limited to the reconstructed common carrier cost of the trip.
Air Carriers (FTR §301-10)
Use of Government Contract Fares
The Federal Government maintains contracts with air common carriers to provide discounted fares between selected pairs of cities (City-Pair Fares) and when they are available, the City-Pair Fares must be used.
(General Rule)
Failure to use available contract fares is a violation of Federal contracts and may leave the Government liable for damages for breach of contract.
Exceptions to the Rule
If a non-contract carrier is used on a city-pair route, one of the following travel conditions must be certified on the Travel Authorization and approved by the travel approving official:
• Airline seating capacity on any scheduled flight of the contract carrier is not available in sufficient time to accomplish the purpose of travel.
• The use of the contract carrier’s flight would require additional overnight lodging.
• The scheduled flight of the contract carrier is not compatible with ED policies and practices regarding travel during scheduled work hours. (Departure requires leaving before 6:30 a.m. or arriving after 6:30 p.m.)
• Exigency or other requirements of the mission necessitate the use of another carrier or mode of transportation.
• On the basis of a comparison of total costs for each individual trip, the use of a “Y” (Coach) or “S” (discounted) class fare (not to be confused with “TDG” (regular base fare) or other promotional fares) is less than the contract fare at the time the reservation is made, considering such factors as actual transportation costs, penalties for not using a contract fare, subsistence, allowable overtime, or lost productive time.
If a contract fare is unavailable, travelers are expected to seek the most economical fares and should make reservations as far in advance as possible, inquiring if any discount fares are available.
Use of Non-Contract Fares
An analysis is required to determine if the use of non-contract fares is permissible on an intended trip. For example, if a contracted city-pair fare is available for the intended travel sectors, then that fare must be used. If a city-pair fare exists but is not available (or if a city-pair fare does not exist), then a non-contract fare may be used if the use of a non-contract fare is advantageous to ED and an exception condition stated in Chapter II, Travel Authorizations, of this Handbook, is satisfied. Analysis may be required to determine if the use of a non-contract fare would provide cost savings to ED. The analysis may include estimating costs based on non-contract “Y” or “S” class fares for the trip and comparing it with the contract fare at the time of making the reservation. Other costs such as actual transportation costs, penalties, subsistence, allowable overtime, lost productive time, etc., resulting from the use of a non-contract carrier, should also be taken into consideration. The non-contract fare may be used if a city-pare fare is unavailable and if the use of a non-contract fare is cost effective for ED. The use of non-contract fares must be specifically authorized and approved by the EXO before obtaining transportation tickets. Cost savings to ED result from overall annual contracts signed with common carriers and not through isolated trips using a non-contract fare that is cheaper than the contract fare.","What are some things that the traveler should keep in mind before selecting mode of transportation?
