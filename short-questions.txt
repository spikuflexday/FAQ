Travel and Entertainment Procedures
Reservation Procedures
When making business travel arrangements with Covington International Travel, the traveler will be asked for a college department code to which the air travel should be charged. Travel booked directly with Covington International Travel of Virginia is covered directly by American Express. The College will charge the appropriate department code directly based upon this information. For travel booked at other travel agencies or directly with the airlines, the traveler should charge the ticket to his/her Pcard (or another method) .The traveler should then submit a properly approved invoice for direct payment to the agency/airline. Though not encouraged, If the traveler used personal funds, the cost may be reimbursed before the date of travel however it will be treated as a Travel Advance (with proper approvals) and will not be expensed until boarding passes have been submitted to the Business Office. This expense will be subject to the same settlement requirements as settlement for cash Travel Advances. It is important the traveler recognize that travel paid directly by the College to an outside agency or airline, or not charged on his/her Pcard, is not covered by the Pcard business travel insurance.

Travel Advance
Travel advances will be issued to College faculty, staff and students traveling on College business. Travel advances will be made to travelers who anticipate incurring out-of-pocket cash expenses in excess of $100 per trip. Thus, if cash expenses (i.e., expenses such as taxis, tolls, tips, and meals not chargeable to the Pcard) will likely exceed $100, a travel advance can be approved by the traveler’s chairperson or department head (or their designee). A travel advance should not be issued for airfare, lodging, service payments such as honoraria, conference fees, or other substantial costs that can be prepaid, prearranged, invoiced, or charged on the Pcard.
Authorization of a travel advance should be documented on the Request for Travel Advance (Attachment C1) and submitted to the Business Office where the travel advance is processed. The request should be submitted at least 7 working days prior to the departure date.
After travel is complete, an approved Travel Expense Summary (Attachment B1) should be submitted to the Business Office (Attachment E). If the advance exceeded the actual expenses, a check made payable to Sweet Briar College should accompany the Travel Expense Summary. If expenses were greater than the advance, the College will reimburse the traveler the net amount due.
A travel advance will be held as a receivable from the traveler until a supporting Travel Expense Summary is processed by the Business Office. A travel advance shall be settled promptly within30 days after the trip’s completion, and before other advances or reimbursements are requested.
An employee may have only one travel advance outstanding at any given time. Failure to account for a travel advance will result in:
delinquent sixty (60) days
• suspending of travel advance privileges
• payroll deduction of amount advanced this is not clear to me and I wrote it!. You have to return unused
funds within 60 days and expenses must be substantiated within 120 days. These are IRS deadlines- we need to have the travel cleared sooner to expense and show on our books.
delinquent one-hundred and twenty (120) days
• reporting the advance to the IRS on the employee’s Form W-2
• withholding of taxes on the advance from the employee’s paycheck
Once an unsettled advance has been added to the employee’s W-2, it cannot be reversed even if settled.1 Students with an outstanding advance will have the amount in excess of documented expenses charged directly to
their student account.
Faculty Grant Advance
Faculty Grant Advance will be issued to those faculty members who have been awarded a faculty grant and will not be using their college Pcard or do not have a Pcard. Advance and Faculty Travel Grant reimbursement are handled in the Grants Office and require the approval of the Post-Award Grant Administrator. For questions regarding the Faculty Grant please contact Mary
Woerner, Post-Award Grant Administrator at 381-6353 or mwoerner@sbc.edu.

The last section gives space for explanation of unusual expenses or items.
It is on this page where the employee submitting the report signs and well as the approver. This form may be
completed, saved to your desk top and printed.
If an employee has both, paid for some expenses personally and charged some expenses on his/her Pcard . Please submit the original Travel Summary Report with the reimbursement, using copies of Pcard receipts to document the Pcard portion of the report. When reconciling his/her Pcard statement, please submit an approved copy of the report with the original Pcard receipts.
• The travel advance associated with a trip should be deducted from the total expenses.

with it, if applicable. The report should be submitted within 15 working days of the completion of the trip.

Request for Travel Advance Directions Introduction
A travel advance will be made to the traveler who anticipates incurring out-of-pocket cash expenses in excess of $100 per trip. Thus, if cash expenses (i.e., expenses such as taxis, tolls, tips, and meals not chargeable to the Pcard) will likely exceed $100, a travel advance can be approved by the traveler’s chairperson or department head (or their designee). A travel advance cannot be issued for airfare, lodging, service payments such as honoraria, conference fees, or other substantial costs that can be prepaid, prearranged, invoiced, or charged on the Pcard.
For cash expenditures totaling less than $100, the College will reimburse the traveler after the trip in accordance with the College’s stated Travel Policies and Procedures. Exceptions to the $100 minimum can be approved on a case- by-case basis by the traveler’s immediate supervisor or department chairperson.
A travel advance will only be issued to College employees.
Purpose
The purpose of the Request for Travel Advance is to provide a means for travelers who do not have a college Pcard to seek funds in advance of a trip. The form will serve as the Business Office’s documentation supporting the request and approval for the disbursement. In addition, the form will be maintained as an open accounts receivable until the travel advance is cleared with a properly approved Travel Expense Summary Report. The trip must have adequate funding and the Banner foapal to be charged must be on the Travel Advance form.
Completing the Request for Travel Advance
Authorization of a travel advance should be documented on the Request for Travel Advance and submitted to the Business Office, where the advance is processed. The request should be submitted at least 10 working days prior to the departure date.
To provide the individual responsible for departmental approval and the Business Office with adequate information regarding the purpose of the travel advance, the traveler should complete the information requested on the form (see Attachment C1).
Signatures
All Request for Travel Advance forms require the traveler’s manual signature (indicating his/her review of the document) and the manual signature of the department chairperson or department head (or their appropriate designee) indicating their approval of the advance. No Request for Travel Advance forms will be accepted without these signatures.

///////////////////////////////////////
Responsibility of Traveler after Trip
After travel is complete, an approved Travel Expense Summary (Attachment B1) should be submitted to the Business Office (Attachment F). If the advance exceeded the actual expenses, a check made payable to Sweet Briar College should accompany the Travel Expense Summary. If expenses were greater than the advance, the College will reimburse the traveler the net amount due.26
A travel advance will be held as a receivable from the traveler until a supporting Travel Expense Summary is processed by the Business Office (Attachment F). A travel advance should be settled promptly (generally within 15 working days of the completion of the trip), and before other advances or reimbursements are requested.
Failure to Account for an Advance on a Timely Basis
An employee may have only one travel advance outstanding at any given time. Occasionally there will be a need for an advance while having an outstanding advance (i.e. team travel, foreign travel). Approval for an advance while one is outstanding (less than 15 days (again, 30 days is usually the turnaround time) is required from the Associate Vice President for Finance and Administration. Failure to account for a travel advance within 120 days will result in:
• suspending of travel advance privileges
• reporting the advance to the IRS on the traveler’s W-2
• withholding of taxes on the advance from the traveler’s paycheck • payroll deduction (within 60 days)
Once an unsettled advance has been added to the traveler’s W-2, it cannot be reversed even if settled.
Students with an outstanding advance will have the amount in excess of documented expenses charged directly to their student account.
All Travel Advances for travel during the current fiscal should be reconciled before June 30 in order to expense the travel amounts to the current fiscal year. Advances that are not settled before the fiscal year is closed will reduce the next fiscal year’s budget.
Processing Request for Travel Advance
Properly completed and approved Requests for Travel Advance forms should be forwarded to the Business Office no more than 10 days prior to travel. Incomplete forms will be returned to the individual approving the advance and will not be processed,
