Chapter II – Travel Authorizations
General Requirements
Requirements for Travel Authorizations
Travel shall be authorized only when it is necessary to accomplish the purposes of ED’s mission in the most effective and economical manner. A Travel Authorization must be issued for all travel outside a 35-mile radius of the traveler’s official duty station. For information on travel within a 35-mile radius, see Chapter III, Making Travel Arrangements, Section C, Local Transportation.
Purpose of Travel Authorization
A Travel Authorization:
• Authorizes an employee to incur specific travel expenses; • Estimates expenses;
• Obligates funds; and
Covers employee for liability purposes.
Authorization Approvals
An ED Approving Official (Reviewer, Approver or Certifier) ensures that the travel complies with ED policies and the FTR; that the travel is conducted effectively and economically; and that funds are available to support the authorization.
Per Diem versus Actual Expense
Per diem should generally be authorized for all travel
beyond ED’s local travel radius. Actual lodging expense must be authorized in advance by the Director, Functional Applications Group (or his/her designee), who has been delegated the authority to perform this function, in those special circumstances when travel is to an unusually-expensive location and per diem is inadequate. See Chapter IV: Per Diem and Chapter V: Reimbursement for Actual Subsistence, of this Handbook, for additional information on per diem and actual subsistence.
Scheduling Travel
To the extent possible, employees and supervisors should plan and schedule travel during duty hours.
Overtime During Travel Hours
Overtime may be authorized for employees for hours in actual travel status outside of the employee’s regular tour of duty hours when the travel:
• Involves performance of actual work while traveling;
• Is incident to travel that involves the performance of work while
traveling; and
• Results from events that could not be scheduled or controlled administratively.
All overtime must be approved and authorized in advance through a memorandum, which must be approved by the individual traveler’s budgeting and approving official(s). See Personnel Manual Instruction (PMI) 550-3, Premium Pay, Attachment A, for more details.

Chapter II – Travel Authorizations
General Requirements
Compensatory Time Off for Time in Travel Status During Off-Duty Hours
Employees may receive compensatory time (comp time) off for travel for those hours spent in a travel status. Travel status includes only the time actually spent traveling between the official duty station and a temporary duty station, or between two temporary duty stations, and the usual waiting time that precedes or interrupts such travel. Additional guidance and examples are provided by the Memorandum for Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies, Compensatory Time Off for Travel and in PMI 550-4, Compensatory Time Off for Official Travel.
• This policy only applies to travel time that is not otherwise compensable as regular overtime/compensatory time.
• Compensatory time earned under these circumstances must be used within 26 pay periods.
• Employees leaving the agency’s employment may not be paid for unused compensatory time.
• Bi-weekly and per annum pay caps do not apply as long as the travel time is not otherwise compensable as regular overtime/compensatory time.
Within 30 days upon his/her return from official travel, the employee must complete and submit Attachment A in PMI 550-4, Compensatory Time Off for Official Travel, with a copy of the approved itinerary received for authorized travel to request compensatory time for travel. Supervisors will review and approve the employee’s request so the timekeeper can enter the appropriate amount of compensatory time for travel into the automated payroll system. A copy of the approved compensatory (“time”?) and flexsheet should be kept with the travel documentation in the event of a travel review/audit.
Employees who fail to submit their requests and appropriate supporting documentation for official travel within the required timeframe will not receive any credit for compensatory time for that travel.
Compensatory time for travel must be tracked and maintained separately from other types of compensatory time. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the compensatory time for travel is properly recorded before they certify the employee’s electronic time card for release.
Combining Personal and Official Travel
When a traveler wishes to combine personal and official travel, the Approving Officer (Reviewer, Approver or Certifier) needs to review the situation against policy guidelines. The general rule is that a traveler on official business may take annual leave in conjunction with the official trip. In all such cases, the per diem that the traveler is entitled to should be reviewed to ensure that the traveler pays for expenses incurred on leave. Travelers are entitled to per diem only during the time that they are on official business travel. If a traveler chooses an indirect route or an interrupted route as a matter of personal preference, then the Approving Officer should verify that the per diem allowed to the traveler does not exceed the amount allowed for uninterrupted travel by a direct route. The traveler will only be issued a ticket for official Government travel and must exchange it for a personal ticket. When a ticket becomes a personal ticket, the traveler will be personally liable for the cost of the ticket and any changes or cancellations to the ticket. Per diem will begin at the start of official ED travel and will end when the personal travel begins.

Traveler’s Responsibilities
An employee traveling on official business is expected to exercise the same care and reasonableness in incurring expenses that a prudent person would exercise if traveling on personal business. The traveler will limit expenses to those that are essential to the transaction of official business. Employees will be responsible for paying increased costs that result from personal preference. Employees must travel to their destination by the usually traveled route unless ED authorizes or approves a different route as officially necessary. In addition, ED has to find it in its best interest to authorize travel from a location other than the official duty station.
Personal convenience is not a reason for ED to alter the travel.

/////////////////////////////////////////
Preparation of Travel Authorization
Each trip that an employee intends to take must have a travel authorization. A single travel authorization may contain multiple destinations as long as a single departure and return to the traveler's official duty station or authorized point occurs. Authorizations and payment of transportation expenses are limited to those expenses that result in the greatest advantage to the government (e.g. the costs that would be incurred for roundtrip travel between the official duty station and the TDY site). All travel authorizations must be created using ED’s electronic travel system. Please refer to E2 End User Manual, the electronic travel system end-user guide, for assistance. Note: ED has implemented an electronic travel system. Printed copies of completed travel authorizations are not an ED requirement. Employees may choose to print completed authorizations to carry with them for TDY assignments. Printed authorizations do not have to become part of the retained travel documentation.
Information Required
The following is required to prepare a Travel Authorization:
• Traveler’s Name and ID Number;
• Itinerary;
• Purpose of Travel;
• Estimated Costs;
• Accounting Data;
• Special Authorizations; and
Approval Stamp.
Assignment of Travel Authorization
The Travel Authorization Number is generated automatically in the electronic travel system. The first two positions of the travel authorization number designate the Principal Office organizational code and are followed by a sequential number (e.g., EL0000...).
Cost Estimation
Travelers must estimate total costs of the trip for obligation purposes. Estimated costs should include:
• Per diem, reduced, conference or actual subsistence lodging rates;
• Transportation costs through the use of a contracted common carrier; and
Other reimbursable costs (i.e. taxis, phone calls, etc.).
Accounting Classification Identification
The traveler or the traveler’s Principal Office must assign the
appropriate accounting data for obligating the funds.
Emergency Travel Procedures
There may be a need for emergency travel where authorizations have not been created and/or certified in the electronic travel system. Since the Travel Management Center (TMC) requires a travel authorization prior to the issuance of airline tickets, Executive Offices have established emergency travel procedures to manually create (verbal) authorizations for travelers who are unable to generate a system authorization in sufficient time prior to departure. Upon returning from the trip, the traveler will be required to complete the electronic authorization, referencing the emergency TA number in the Remarks Section. The electronic travel authorization must be completely routed (certified) prior to creating and processing a voucher. The traveler should contact the Principal Office's Executive Office for further details on this process.
Specific Authorization
When applicable, the following activities or expenditures must be specifically authorized in the Travel Authorization:
• Annual leave of 8 hours or more while in travel status;
• Auto rentals under GSA contract;
• Commercial car rentals;*
• Use of non-contract airline carrier;*
• Use of GSA auto;
• Travel by privately-owned vehicle (POV) in lieu of Common
Carrier;*
• Foreign travel;*
• First class accommodations;*
• Use of taxis;
• Pre-employment interview travel;
• Laundry on trips of 4 consecutive nights of lodging or more;
• Actual subsistence;*
• Acceptance of payment from a non-Federal source for travel
expenses (In-kind travel);*
• Use of a foreign air carrier;
• Use of reduced fares for group or charter arrangements;
• Use of extra-fare train service;*
• Travel by ship;
• Use of a Government aircraft;
• Payment of a reduced per diem rate;
• Travel expenses related to emergency travel;
• Transportation expenses related to threatened law
enforcement/investigative employees and members of their
families; or
Travel expenses related to attendance at a conference.

Preparation of Travel Authorization
Travel Authorization Approvals (Route Lists)
All travel authorizations are approved through an electronic routing process in the electronic travel system. The process begins with the electronic routing of the document after the end-user/traveler or the traveler’s group administrator has created it. After certification (or complete routing of the document), documents are chosen randomly to undergo a series of pre-audits prior to the datalinking process. ED travel auditors review those documents chosen through the random audit process for appropriateness and adherence to ED and Federal policies. If auditors identify issues/discrepancies, documents are electronically returned to the traveler for correction or justification. Any document returned to the traveler must begin the route process anew after the correction has been made.
Based on the route model that has been assigned to the traveler, the document then proceeds to the next level of approval, which is usually the employee's supervisor. The final step in the routing process is the Certifying Official. Once the authorization is certified, it will pass through a nightly interface into the accounting system creating an obligation in the general ledger. In addition, once the travel authorization has been certified, this then triggers the TMC to issue common carrier e-tickets within the designated two business day timeframe.
Delegation of Approving Authority
Authority to approve the Travel Authorization may be re-delegated to the lowest level of management that has responsibility for both program accomplishment and obligation or commitment of funds.
Travel Authorization Amendments
Travel Authorizations should be amended when:
• Dates of travel change (depart or return by two or more days);
• The travel location changes;
• Cost of trip is increased by 25% or more of the amount
authorized; or
• Mode of Transportation changes.

Chapter III: Making Travel Arrangements
(FTR §301-50)
Travel Management Centers.  
Definition
Travel Management Centers (TMC) are travel agencies with Federal contracts to provide travel services to all Government employees conducting official travel. TMCs must be used to secure lodgings, rental cars, and purchase common carrier tickets for all official ED travel. A processing fee is charged for each ticketed transaction including cancellations that occur after a ticket has been issued. Travel reservations should be made via the TMC’s on-line booking engine, unless unusual circumstances prevent the use of on-line booking.
If a traveler does not meet one of the exceptions listed below, and books outside of the TMC, the traveler is responsible for any additional costs resulting from failure to use the TMC. Prior approval from the Executive Officer (EXO) must be received before securing common carrier reservations outside of the TMC.
Exceptions to using the TMC
• The primary reason travelers are required to use a TMC to book their lodging reservations is to ensure that the lodging property meets the Hotel/Motel Fire Safety Act. All lodging properties participating in the FedRooms Program must meet the Hotel/Motel Fire Safety Act. Therefore, a Federal traveler choosing to stay at one of these lodging properties may make the reservations directly with the lodging property, instead of using the TMC.
• TMCs can only reserve rooms at lodging properties that are in their system. If a lodging property is not listed in the TMC’s system, the traveler can make that lodging reservation outside of the TMC, as long as the lodging property is in compliance with the Hotel/Motel Fire Safety Act.
• TMCs cannot book lodging reservations for employees who are attending conferences/training where rooms have been blocked off by a third party other than the TMC. In these cases, the traveler would need to book the reservation outside the TMC.
In some cases, the TMC’s on-line booking systems can only book car rental reservations at airport locations. If a traveler needs to make car rental reservations at other than an airport location, the traveler can either call the TMC to make the reservation or call the car rental company directly.
Services Provided
TMCs provide a wide range of travel services, including:
• Reservations and ticketing for travel via common carriers (air, rail, bus, steamship);
• Reservations for rental cars;
• Hotel/motel reservations and arrangements for conference
facilities;
• Email notification of electronic common carrier tickets;
• Periodic management reports on travel activity;
Point of contact for ED officials when problems arise; and • Offers on Supersaver/Penalty fares.       
Use of Other Travel Agencies
No other travel agency may be used to purchase travel services for official government travel. Using travel agents other than the established TMC for ED is a violation of the TMC’s contract with the Federal Government and may subject the Government to a suit for damages for breach of contract. Use of other means may also result in a claim for reimbursement being denied. Only emergency situations allow for the purchase of tickets directly from a common carrier.
A traveler should immediately contact the TMC once he/she has notification of a trip cancellation. If reservations are cancelled before a ticket is issued there will be no fees charged. If reservations are cancelled after a ticket has been issued, the ticket issuing fee will be charged.
E-Ticket vs. Paper Ticket
ED encourages the use of E-tickets rather than paper tickets. Most airlines charge a processing fee for issuing paper tickets. This fee is only reimbursable if there is a justified reason for requesting a paper ticket.
//////////////////////////////////////
What are Travel Management Centers?
///
Travel Management Centers (TMC) are travel agencies with Federal contracts to provide travel services to all Government employees conducting official travel. TMCs must be used to secure lodgings, rental cars, and purchase common carrier tickets for all official ED travel.

What happens if a traveler does not use the Travel Management Center to book travel?
///
If a traveler does not meet one of the exceptions listed below, and books outside of the TMC, the traveler is responsible for any additional costs resulting from failure to use the TMC. Prior approval from the Executive Officer (EXO) must be received before securing common carrier reservations outside of the TMC.
///
What are the conditions for a traveler to not use TMC while making travel arrangements?
///
• The primary reason travelers are required to use a TMC to book their lodging reservations is to ensure that the lodging property meets the Hotel/Motel Fire Safety Act. All lodging properties participating in the FedRooms Program must meet the Hotel/Motel Fire Safety Act. Therefore, a Federal traveler choosing to stay at one of these lodging properties may make the reservations directly with the lodging property, instead of using the TMC.

No other travel agency may be used to purchase travel services for official government travel. Using travel agents other than the established TMC for ED is a violation of the TMC’s contract with the Federal Government and may subject the Government to a suit for damages for breach of contract. Use of other means may also result in a claim for reimbursement being denied. Only emergency situations allow for the purchase of tickets directly from a common carrier.
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
B. Selecting a Mode of Transportation
Modes of Transportation
Travelers should use the most direct or usually traveled route. Additional transportation costs incurred by an employee who elects for personal reasons to travel by an indirect route are the employee's responsibility. (See Chapter IV; Per Diem, Section D, Interruptions to Per Diem Entitlement, for additional information.)
ED travelers are required by law to use the most expeditious and cost- efficient means of transportation when on official travel. Usually, this will be a common carrier. Travelers must:
(a) Limit authorization and payment of transportation expenses to those expenses that result in the greatest advantage to the Government; and
(b) Ensure that travel is by the most expeditious means practicable.
Airlines are normally used for long distance travel since they usually result in the lowest overall cost. (Please note: Travelers must use city- pair fares and government contract carriers to accomplish their mission unless prior approval and justification have been given for non- contract use.)
When travelers have multiple (local) airport choices, travelers will need to request approval to fly from the higher cost airport if the total airfare cost differential exceeds $250. This approval must be obtained in advance of the trip from the traveler’s respective Principal Officer. If the cost is less than $250, no Principal Officer approval is required.
In addition, travelers can fly direct non-stop contract carrier service in lieu of connecting contract carrier flights provided that the cost differential does not exceed $250. Approval of requests exceeding the $250 threshold must be obtained in advance of the trip from the traveler’s respective Principal Officer. If the cost is less than $250, no Principal Officer approval is required.
Other means of transportation, such as bus, train, or use of privately owned vehicles (POVs) and the payment of mileage, may be authorized if it is determined to be advantageous and economical to ED. When the use of a POV results in trip costs that are in excess of the common carrier cost for the same trip, reimbursement and compensatory time calculations are limited to the reconstructed common carrier cost of the trip.
Air Carriers (FTR §301-10)
Use of Government Contract Fares
The Federal Government maintains contracts with air common carriers to provide discounted fares between selected pairs of cities (City-Pair Fares) and when they are available, the City-Pair Fares must be used.
(General Rule)
Failure to use available contract fares is a violation of Federal contracts and may leave the Government liable for damages for breach of contract.
Exceptions to the Rule
If a non-contract carrier is used on a city-pair route, one of the following travel conditions must be certified on the Travel Authorization and approved by the travel approving official:
• Airline seating capacity on any scheduled flight of the contract carrier is not available in sufficient time to accomplish the purpose of travel.
• The use of the contract carrier’s flight would require additional overnight lodging.
• The scheduled flight of the contract carrier is not compatible with ED policies and practices regarding travel during scheduled work hours. (Departure requires leaving before 6:30 a.m. or arriving after 6:30 p.m.)
• Exigency or other requirements of the mission necessitate the use of another carrier or mode of transportation.
• On the basis of a comparison of total costs for each individual trip, the use of a “Y” (Coach) or “S” (discounted) class fare (not to be confused with “TDG” (regular base fare) or other promotional fares) is less than the contract fare at the time the reservation is made, considering such factors as actual transportation costs, penalties for not using a contract fare, subsistence, allowable overtime, or lost productive time.
If a contract fare is unavailable, travelers are expected to seek the most economical fares and should make reservations as far in advance as possible, inquiring if any discount fares are available.
Use of Non-Contract Fares
An analysis is required to determine if the use of non-contract fares is permissible on an intended trip. For example, if a contracted city-pair fare is available for the intended travel sectors, then that fare must be used. If a city-pair fare exists but is not available (or if a city-pair fare does not exist), then a non-contract fare may be used if the use of a non-contract fare is advantageous to ED and an exception condition stated in Chapter II, Travel Authorizations, of this Handbook, is satisfied. Analysis may be required to determine if the use of a non-contract fare would provide cost savings to ED. The analysis may include estimating costs based on non-contract “Y” or “S” class fares for the trip and comparing it with the contract fare at the time of making the reservation. Other costs such as actual transportation costs, penalties, subsistence, allowable overtime, lost productive time, etc., resulting from the use of a non-contract carrier, should also be taken into consideration. The non-contract fare may be used if a city-pare fare is unavailable and if the use of a non-contract fare is cost effective for ED. The use of non-contract fares must be specifically authorized and approved by the EXO before obtaining transportation tickets. Cost savings to ED result from overall annual contracts signed with common carriers and not through isolated trips using a non-contract fare that is cheaper than the contract fare.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
What are some things that the traveler should keep in mind before selecting mode of transportation?
///
ED travelers are required by law to use the most expeditious and cost- efficient means of transportation when on official travel. Usually, this will be a common carrier. Travelers must:
(a) Limit authorization and payment of transportation expenses to those expenses that result in the greatest advantage to the Government; and
(b) Ensure that travel is by the most expeditious means practicable.
///
What airport should be chosen for travel when there are multiple local airport choices?
///
When travelers have multiple (local) airport choices, travelers will need to request approval to fly from the higher cost airport if the total airfare cost differential exceeds $250. This approval must be obtained in advance of the trip from the traveler’s respective Principal Officer. If the cost is less than $250, no Principal Officer approval is required.
///
If there is an option to fly non-stop vs flying with a connecting stop, which one should be chosen?
///
In addition, travelers can fly direct non-stop contract carrier service in lieu of connecting contract carrier flights provided that the cost differential does not exceed $250. Approval of requests exceeding the $250 threshold must be obtained in advance of the trip from the traveler’s respective Principal Officer. If the cost is less than $250, no Principal Officer approval is required.
///
Which carriers are to be chosen for travel?
///
The Federal Government maintains contracts with air common carriers to provide discounted fares between selected pairs of cities (City-Pair Fares) and when they are available, the City-Pair Fares must be used.
///
When can one use a non-contract carrier for travel?
///
If a non-contract carrier is used on a city-pair route, one of the following travel conditions must be certified on the Travel Authorization and approved by the travel approving official:
• Airline seating capacity on any scheduled flight of the contract carrier is not available in sufficient time to accomplish the purpose of travel.
• The use of the contract carrier’s flight would require additional overnight lodging.
• The scheduled flight of the contract carrier is not compatible with ED policies and practices regarding travel during scheduled work hours. (Departure requires leaving before 6:30 a.m. or arriving after 6:30 p.m.)

Non-contract carriers sometimes offer restricted or unrestricted coach fares to the general public, which are lower than the government contract fares. In such cases, the lower fare(s) may be used in accordance with procedures described below. They should not be used simply to avoid use of the contract carrier. However, when a non-contract carrier offers a commercial fare lower than its contract fare, the lower fare should be obtained provided the traveler can meet the requirements of the lower fare.
One or more of the following conditions, which must be certified on the travel authorization in advance of the trip, must apply if a carrier other than the contract carrier is used for travel within a contract route:
• Seating space or the scheduled flight is not available in time to accomplish the purpose of travel, or use of contract service would require the traveler to incur unnecessary overnight lodging costs that would increase the total cost of the trip; or
• The contract carrier’s flight schedule is inconsistent with those who are required to travel during normal working hours; or
• A non-contract carrier offers a lower fare available to the general public, the use of which will result in a lower trip cost to the Government. This determination should be based on a cost comparison to include the combined cost of transportation, lodging, meals, and related expenses; or
Note: This exception DOES NOT APPLY if the contract carrier offers a Comparable fare and has seats available at that fare, or if the lower fare offered by a non-contract carrier is restricted to Government and military travelers on official business and may only be purchased with a CBA contractor issued charge card.
Rail service is available and such service is cost effective and consistent with mission requirements.
Use of Super- Saver Fares
A super-saver fare is generally defined as a non-refundable, discounted, airline ticket that must be purchased within 24 hours of making the reservation and that requires a Saturday night stay at the destination. The special fare is usually offered only for a limited time.
Depending on the market served, a requirement may exist to purchase the ticket at least 14 days prior to departure.
The use of a super-saver fare requires that individual cost comparisons be computed between contract and non-contract carriers. When doing individual cost comparisons, we may assume that the cancellation penalty will not be invoked each time a super-saver fare is used, as the decision on how to compute penalty fees associated with the cancellation of non- contract carriers could be based on overall ED experience. In our judgment, we believe it is reasonable to assume that no more than one out of every two super-saver trips will be modified or canceled. Accordingly, extended trips using non-contract carriers may be approved if the penalty does not exceed 150 percent of the overall trip savings.
In order for a super-saver fare to be used, the following must hold true:
• the super-saver fare is the lower cost fare;
• the fare is available to the general public, and is not a “me too” fare; the
“me too” fare is a companion type fare. For example: the airlines are offering a special promotion where one traveler purchases a ticket for a certain price and the second traveler purchases a ticket for a penny;
• use of the fare will lower the overall trip cost; and
• the penalty the non-contract carrier may impose will not exceed 150
percent of the expected savings.
Examples of when the use of a non-contract carrier may be approved and disapproved are listed below:
Example 1 (Standard Government Travel):
Official Travel: Using GSA designated Contract Carrier
Travel Dates: Wednesday, May 26 thru Friday, May 28
Constructive Cost: Contract carrier fare $750.00
Per Diem , 2 nights/3days $306.00
Subway, taxi fare (estimate) $ 30.00
TOTAL CONSTRUCTIVE COST $1086.00
Example 2 (allowable):
Official Travel: Using a non-contract carrier, where the travel dates are extended to include a Saturday night stay at the temporary duty site and return on Sunday, May 30.
Travel Dates: Wednesday, May 26, thru Sunday, May 30
Constructive Cost: Non-contract air fare $306.00 
Per diem, 4 nights/5 days 650.00
Subway, taxi fare (estimate)$ 30.00 
TOTAL CONSTRUCTIVE COST $986.00
(Expected savings $100.00)
(The penalty a non-contract carrier may impose is $150.00)
The penalty a non-contract carrier may impose cannot exceed 150 percent of the expected savings. In this case the trip is allowable since the penalty is no more than 150 percent of the total trip savings (penalty imposed is $150.00 divided by savings $100.00 = 150%).
Example 3 (unallowable):
Using the same figures as Example 2, but establishing the penalty the non- contract carrier may impose at $155.00, the trip is not allowable since the cancellation penalty exceeds the savings of $100.00 by more than 150 percent (penalty imposed is $155.00 divided by savings of $100.00 = 155%).
It is very important that cancellation of super-saver fares be kept to a minimum if savings are to be realized. The EXO must approve requests of this nature and maintain records for review by OCFO. These records must show the cost comparison and reflect penalty fees incurred.
Because of various legal considerations, the traveler must initiate requests for extended stay to take advantage of super-saver fares. Under these circumstances, it is assumed that no overtime pay or other compensation will be paid to the employee, except for additional per diem when travel dates are extended to achieve overall trip savings.

Premium Class Travel (General Rule)
For official business travel, both domestic and international, you must use coach-class accommodations. Travelers are NOT PERMITTED to use premium class accommodations (first-class, business-class, or the equivalent) except as provided below. (FTR – §301-10.122; §301-10.123; §301-10.124.)
Exceptions To Rule
• All premium (first and business) class travel must be approved by the Director, Financial Applications Group, or his/her designee in advance of travel. The following are definitions and justifications for Premium Class Travel.
You may request the use of First-Class airline accommodations only when ED specifically authorizes/approves your use of such accommodations, for the reasons given as follows:
(a) No coach or business-class accommodations are reasonably available. “Reasonably available” means available on an airline that is scheduled to leave within 24 hours of your proposed departure time, or scheduled to arrive within 24 hours of your proposed arrival time.
(b) When use of first-class is necessary to accommodate a disability or other special need. A disability must be substantiated in writing by a competent medical authority. A special need must be substantiated in writing. If you are authorized to have an attendant (to accommodate your special needs) accompany you, you may be authorized for the attendant to use first-class accommodations if you require the attendant’s services en route.
(c) When exceptional security circumstances require first-class travel. Exceptional security circumstances include, but are not limited to:
(1) Use of other than first-class accommodations would endanger your life or Government property;
(2) You are an agent on protective detail and you are accompanying an individual authorized to use first-class accommodations; or
(3) You are a courier or control officer accompanying controlled pouches or packages.
(d) When required because of agency mission.*
*ED will not authorize premium class travel based on mission criteria alone. All requests must meet additional criteria for premium class travel.
Note: You may upgrade to first-class at your personal expense, including through redemption of frequent flyer benefits. This must be done outside of ED’s Travel Management Center, directly with the specific airline. Any changes relating to upgrades must be done after the ‘official’ ticket has been issued through ED’s Travel Management Center.
Business Class accommodations will only be approved for the following reasons:
Regularly scheduled flights between origin/destination points (including connecting points) provide only first-class and business- class accommodations and you certify such on your authorization; or
No space is available in coach-class accommodations in time to accomplish the mission, which is urgent and cannot be postponed; or
When use of business-class accommodations is necessary to accommodate your disability or other special need. Disability must be substantiated in writing by a competent medical authority. Special need must be substantiated in writing. If you are authorized to have an attendant (to accommodate your special needs) accompany you, you may be authorized for the attendant to use business-class accommodations if you require the attendant’s services en route; or
Security purposes or exceptional circumstances with the use of business-class accommodations essential to the successful performance of the agency’s mission; or
Coach-class accommodations on an authorized/approved foreign air carrier do not provide adequate sanitation or health standards; or
The use results in an overall cost savings to the Government by avoiding additional subsistence costs, overtime, or lost productive time while awaiting coach-class accommodations; or
Your transportation costs are paid in full through agency acceptance of payment from a non-federal source in accordance with the FTR; or
Where the origin and/or destination are Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS), and the scheduled flight time, including stopovers and change of planes, is in excess of 14 hours (in this instance you will not be eligible for a rest stop en route or a rest period upon arrival at your duty site); or
When required because of agency mission.*
*ED will not authorize premium class travel based on mission criteria alone. All requests must meet additional criteria for premium class travel.
Note: You may upgrade to business-class at your personal expense, including through redemption of frequent flyer benefits. This must be done outside of ED’s Travel Management Center, directly with the specific airline. Any changes relating to upgrades must be done after the ‘official’ ticket has been issued through ED’s Travel Management Center.
Premium class travel will not be authorized for either temporary duty or permanent change of station (relocation) when the employee is not required to report to duty the following day. This is considered a rest stop. ED does not authorize rest stops in support of ED travel.
ED will not authorize premium class travel based on mission criteria alone. All requests must meet additional criteria for premium class travel.
Blanket annual certifications for disabilities or special needs will not be allowed. Each trip must be approved on a case-by-case basis and have all required documentation provided.
Frequent Flyer/ Bonus Programs and Other Promotional Materials
Travelers are encouraged to enroll in frequent flyer traveler programs offered by various common carriers, hotel/motel chains and automobile rental companies.
The use of contract carriers has precedence and must be used when available. Employees may not choose a carrier just because he/she is a member of the carrier’s frequent flyer program.
Use of Benefits
The employee may retain benefits obtained through official travel (frequent flyer miles, bonus flights, reduced fare coupons, cash, gifts, credit toward future free or reduced costs of services or goods, etc.). The FTR allows travelers to retain and make personal use of promotional items earned while on official Government travel if the promotional item is obtained under the same terms as those offered to the general public and at no additional cost to the Government. If the employee voluntarily gives up a seat on an airline, the employee may keep the compensation as long as it doesn't interfere with official duties, no additional expense to the Government is involved, and leave is taken when required.
A traveler who receives compensation from an airline for being denied a reserved seat must provide any payment received for liquidated damages to ED.
Note: Only the airlines themselves (NOT the TMC) can make reservations when frequent flyer miles are “cashed in.”

Travel Gainsharing Program
If lodging expenses are below the maximum allowable lodging rate for the travel destination, the traveler is entitled to one-half the amount ED saves after a cumulative savings of $400. If the traveler stays with a friend or relative and has no lodging expenses, he/she will receive one-half the lodging rate for that particular city after a cumulative savings of $400. If the traveler is enrolled in a frequent flyer program and saves ED the cost of a common carrier ticket, he/she is entitled to one-half the savings from receiving the award after a cumulative savings of $400. Employees must fill out the appropriate savings form (which can be obtained in Executive Offices) after returning from travel. Travelers must submit the savings form before the end of the fiscal year in which the trip(s) occurred; any forms received after the fiscal year will be denied. Further information and required forms for filing can be reviewed/downloaded on ConnectED, through the Travel Information link.
Processing of Unused Airline Tickets
All unused airline tickets should be returned by the traveler either prior to or at the time the Travel Voucher is submitted. For tickets purchased with the contractor issued travel charge card, the traveler is responsible for ensuring that the unused tickets are returned to the TMC and that a credit is issued to the contractor issued travel charge card for all unused tickets.
Rental Cars (FTR §301- 10.400)
Authorization Requirements
If travel requires the use of a rental car, the employee must prepare a justification of the cost effectiveness of a rental vehicle over other methods of transportation. This justification must demonstrate the cost effectiveness of the rental car use and must be entered in the ‘Remarks’ field of the travel authorization. The electronic approval of the Travel Certifying Official on the Travel Authorization is sufficient approval for the use of the rental vehicle. Some Principal Offices may request rental car justification in writing prior to creating the Travel Authorization.
The rental of cars and other vehicles is authorized when advantageous to the Government. Personal convenience is not adequate justification for rental of a vehicle.
Contracted Rental Agents for Automobiles
A list of rental car agents may be obtained through ED’s TMC or by consulting DOD’s Surface Deployment and Distribution Command’s website.
Always ask for the Government rate.
Responsibilities of Employees
Employees, 18 years or older, who rent vehicles while on official travel, are
responsible for:
• Providing proof of official travel;
• Using the vehicle for official purposes only;
• The safe operation of the vehicle;
• Possessing a valid driver’s license;
• Making an effort to return the car to the rental agency with a full tank of gas or pre-purchasing gas from the automobile rental company; and
• Using least costly cars (upgrading of car requires prior approval if increase in cost is involved).
Employees using the vehicle for personal travel in conjunction with Official Travel should obtain a second rental agreement for such personal travel.
Car Pick-up and Return
Under normal circumstances, employees should pick up the rental automobile on the first day of official travel and return it promptly when further use is no longer necessary. Some travel cases may warrant the rental automobile to be obtained on the last day of work or on a non-work day. Such cases should be discussed with a supervisor and travel approving official before obtaining the rental automobile.
Government Administration Rate Supplement (GARS)
GARS is an automatic fee that has been recently negotiated with the contracted rental car companies and the DOD that charges $5 per day for a Government rated rental car. GARS will reimburse the rental car companies for those costs incurred which are peculiar to doing business with the Government, including the application of the agreement terms and conditions on a worldwide basis, the rental of vehicles to employees under age 25, acceptance of properly licensed fellow Government employees on official business as additional drivers, and a guarantee of the maximum rates for at least 60 days. GARS will be paid by all renters and shall be listed separately on the rental documents. This is a reimbursable expense.
Steps to Take in Case of Repairs or an Accident
1. In case of breakdown, the renter should immediately notify the car rental company and request a replacement vehicle (if necessary) and instructions for the disposition of the disabled vehicle.
2. In case of an accident, the renter should notify the car rental company, notify the police, and obtain a police report for the company. If a police report is not available, the renter will be required to provide the car rental company with all the exchanged information from all parties involved in the accident/incident.
3. The renter is required to promptly notify the location from which the car was rented and complete a company accident report (if applicable).
4. Additionally, the renter should keep a record of the location and representative who assisted the renter for follow-up purposes.

Damage Waiver and Insurance
Insurance is covered under the Government contract. Travelers are discouraged from buying additional insurance. Employees who buy additional insurance will not be reimbursed for this cost.
For a rental automobile used for official travel and covered by the Government contract rental agreement, ED only permits transporting Government employees and other individuals who conduct official business on behalf of ED. The standard insurance included in the Government rental agreement does not provide coverage for unauthorized passengers who could be injured as a result of an accident.
If a relative, dependent, or other unauthorized passenger accompanies an ED traveler on official duty, the automobile should be leased using a private rental agreement, and the traveler’s reimbursement will be limited to the cost of a similar rental agreement to the Government.
The Government contract will cover the cost of damages due to an accident or burglary, including any deductible. However, if an employee was found to be driving recklessly, or in violation of traffic laws, the cost for damages may be the responsibility of the employee.
Any claims that arise as a result of personal property loss, injury or death attributable to the use of a rental car should be submitted with all supporting documentation (e.g., police reports, rental contract, etc.) to the Assistant General Counsel for Business and Administrative Law, Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW, LBJ, Room 6C106, Washington DC 20202-2110.
There are times when a traveler gets a lower rate from a car rental company than what the TMC has quoted. However, the rates that are negotiated by the Government include Collision/Damage/Waiver (CDW) Insurance and several other benefits to the Federal traveler that he/she would not get on their own. Usually when a traveler gets a lower rate, the CDW insurance is not included because the traveler is covered by their own personal insurance. Consider what the Federal traveler receives under Insurance and Damage Liability when booking car rental reservations through the TMC: protection against liability for personal injury; death; and property damage from the use of the vehicle; personal injury/wrongful death limits of $100,000 for each person for each accident or event; $300,000 for all persons in each such accident or event; and property damage limits of $25,000 for each occurrence. In addition, the car rental company assumes the entire risk of loss of or damage to rental vehicle (including costs of towing, administrative costs, loss of use, and replacements) from any and every cause whatsoever, including, without limitation, casualty, collision, fire, malicious mischief, vandalism, tire damage, falling objects, overhead damage, glass breakage, strike, civil commotion, theft and mysterious disappearance, except where the loss or damage was caused by non adherence to rules set forth in the contract. Utilizing the Government contract eliminates these worries along with what happens in the event of an accident.
Cost Reimbursement
If the leasing company does not pay for gasoline, expenses should be itemized on the Travel Voucher with attached receipts, when the expenses exceed $75. For all other applicable costs in the maintenance of the vehicle, travelers will be reimbursed as long as the expenses are itemized on the Travel Voucher. All claims for rental cars must be supported by receipts.

Local Transportation
Definition
Travel performed within a 35-mile radius of the employee’s official duty station is considered local travel and does not require a Travel Authorization. Local travel does not allow for the payment of per diem.
Travel within the local radius should be performed using the most advantageous and economical means to ED.
Public Transportation Usage
Subways or buses should be used as appropriate for local transportation (for exceptions, see “taxis”). If available through the employee’s respective Principal Office, employees may use ED- owned subway fare cards for local travel on official Government business.
Public Transportation Bulk Purchases
As a cost-effective measure, offices may purchase a supply of public transportation fare cards in varying amounts for use by their employees when traveling locally on government business.
Offices must institute appropriate internal controls over the fare card to ensure proper use and accounting.
Taxis
Authorization and Usage For Local Travel
Taxicabs may be used by ED employees when official business is performed. ED employees should attempt to secure airport limousine/shuttle service or public transportation whenever possible. The following is a list of examples where a taxi would be approved.
• If heavy or bulk materials are being carried by ED employees.
• If the ED employee is disabled.
• If the employee is dependent on public transportation for
officially ordered work outside regular working hours, and the travel between the employee’s office and home is during hours of infrequently scheduled public transportation or darkness.
Note: The scenarios above are being provided as a guide only and are not inclusive of all instances where a taxi will be approved.
Cost Reimbursement
Taxi reimbursement is based on normally established rates.
Tips are allowed at rates up to fifteen (15) percent of the base fare.

No-Cost Services
ED’s TMC will make the following group conference arrangements at no cost to ED:
• Airline reservations and ticketing for all conference participants;
• Locating conference and lodging facilities that will meet the requirements of the group;
• Lodging/conference reservations for each member of the group; and
• Reservations for meeting/classroom space, breakout space, meals, audio/visual equipment, and group transportation from the lodging facility to the conference facility, if necessary.
Services for A Fee
ED’s TMC will make the following group conference arrangements at a cost (which must be determined in advance) to ED:
• On-site assistance at the conference facility;
• Pre-inspection of the conference facility; and
• Preparation of pamphlets or materials relating to the conference. (However, Government Printing and Binding Regulations must be followed and such materials should be procured through the Government Printing Office.) Materials relating to the location of and about the conference facility will be provided free of charge.
Use of Other Travel Sources
Travel or conference management services offered through the TMC at no cost must be used, and Principal Offices may not obtain these services through another source unless:
• The requesting office sends a cost comparison to the contracting officer demonstrating that using another source will be more cost effective;
• The requesting office sends a justification to the contracting officer showing that the TMC cannot provide services, or that the services cannot reasonably be segregated from other services not available through the TMC; or
The services are available from an 8(a) firm (i.e., a business certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) as being 51% minority owned or operated) at a reasonable price and the contracting officer awards the contract through the 8(a) program.
Travel Arrangement Procedures
To obtain airline tickets, hotel space, conference space, or other travel or conference management services through the
TMC, the following procedures must be followed:
• Select a coordinator within the Principal Office to manage the conference planning and arrangements with the TMC. The coordinator should notify the TMC as soon as possible (preferably 75 days in advance of the date) with the number and names of the participants, the method of payment for air travel, the city and preferred location for the conference.
• Do not make arrangements directly with the conference and lodging facilities without the assistance of the TMC.
Do not make air/land reservations without the assistance of the TMC.
• Use of a contractor, other than the TMC, requires a written justification and cost comparison. The justification should provide information on the use of a contractor for conference services, other than the TMC, that would be more advantageous to ED. Justification should be submitted to Director, Financial Management Policies and Administrative Programs Group, for approval.
• Groups with air-only arrangements, regardless of the size of the group, should be made through ED’s designated TMC.
• Groups of 10 or more requiring air and land arrangements should be booked through the TMC, Group Department Office.
• ED policy on selection of conference sites requires at least three sites to be considered for the location of a conference. Offices must document the alternative sites considered and explain the rationale used in the selection of the conference site.
• Offices are required to maintain records on selection of conference sites and attendees. As required by OMB Bulletin No. 93-11, the records should be available for review. Each Principal Office is responsible for maintaining these records.
Payment Procedures
Payment procedures for groups and conferences are as follows:
• Advise the TMC of the method of payment for common carrier tickets (Government issued Charge Card or CBA). A Purchase Card or Purchase Order may not be used for payment of common carrier tickets.
• All payments made to the conference facility must be made directly to the conference facility, not through the TMC.
If the conference facility requires a “deposit,” this should be done using a purchase card or a purchase order issued directly to the facility. If a purchase order must be issued, note on the purchase order request that “ED’s TMC has secured these arrangements.” By making this notation this informs Contracts and Acquisitions Management (CAM) that competitive bidding is not necessary.

Chapter IV: Per Diem
General Rules
Definition
Per diem is a daily allowance for expenses incurred by an employee on temporary duty travel based on Government-wide rates established by GSA for specific geographical locations. These expenses consist of an average daily lodging cost plus a fixed rate for meals and incidental expenses (M&IE) subject to the maximum rates published by GSA.
Receipts are required for all lodging expenses and any miscellaneous expenses greater than $75. If less than $75, receipts for parking, local transportation, and personal phone calls do not need to be submitted; however, travelers are encouraged to provide receipts for all expenses related to a recently completed trip with the exception of meals.
Covered Expenses
The per diem allowance covers all charges for the following types of expenses:
• Lodging (if lodging is obtained at less than the Government allowable rate, the employee may be eligible to receive a portion of the excess lodging funds under the Travel Gain Sharing Program. Contact your Executive Office for further details).
Note: Lodging taxes are not included as part of the per diem total. Tax- exempt certificates are available for most states.
• Meals and related tips and taxes (expenses specifically for alcoholic beverages, entertainment, and any expenses incurred for other persons are not allowed).
Incidental expenses include fees and tips to porters, baggage carriers, bellhops, hotel maids, airline attendants and parking attendants.
General Rules
No expenses will be covered when incurred at the employee’s official duty station or places of abode except certain expenses covered under an approved Office of Personnel Management (OPM) training course.
Any additional costs incurred for spouse or family while on temporary duty travel must be absorbed by the traveler. Payments made to friends or family for lodging while on temporary duty travel may not be claimed unless substantiated by the employee and approved by the supervisor as a reasonable expense.
One Day Travel
For travel less than 24 hours that requires no lodging, 3⁄4 M&IE may be received if the following is met:
• Travel is outside of the 35-mile radius of the employee’s official duty station
or place of daily commute; and
Travelers are away from their official duty station for at least 12 hours.
