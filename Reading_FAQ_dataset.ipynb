    "doc = 'B. Selecting a Mode of Transportation\\n Use of Special Fares\\nNon-contract carriers sometimes offer restricted or unrestricted coach fares to the general public, which are lower than the government contract fares. In such cases, the lower fare(s) may be used in accordance with procedures described below. They should not be used simply to avoid use of the contract carrier. However, when a non-contract carrier offers a commercial fare lower than its contract fare, the lower fare should be obtained provided the traveler can meet the requirements of the lower fare.\\nOne or more of the following conditions, which must be certified on the travel authorization in advance of the trip, must apply if a carrier other than the contract carrier is used for travel within a contract route:\\n• Seating space or the scheduled flight is not available in time to accomplish the purpose of travel, or use of contract service would require the traveler to incur unnecessary overnight lodging costs that would increase the total cost of the trip; or\\n• The contract carrier’s flight schedule is inconsistent with those who are required to travel during normal working hours; or\\n• A non-contract carrier offers a lower fare available to the general public, the use of which will result in a lower trip cost to the Government. This determination should be based on a cost comparison to include the combined cost of transportation, lodging, meals, and related expenses; or\\nNote: This exception DOES NOT APPLY if the contract carrier offers a Comparable fare and has seats available at that fare, or if the lower fare offered by a non-contract carrier is restricted to Government and military travelers on official business and may only be purchased with a CBA contractor issued charge card.\\nRail service is available and such service is cost effective and consistent with mission requirements.\\nUse of Super- Saver Fares\\nA super-saver fare is generally defined as a non-refundable, discounted, airline ticket that must be purchased within 24 hours of making the reservation and that requires a Saturday night stay at the destination. The special fare is usually offered only for a limited time.\\nDepending on the market served, a requirement may exist to purchase the ticket at least 14 days prior to departure.\\nThe use of a super-saver fare requires that individual cost comparisons be computed between contract and non-contract carriers. When doing individual cost comparisons, we may assume that the cancellation penalty will not be invoked each time a super-saver fare is used, as the decision on how to compute penalty fees associated with the cancellation of non- contract carriers could be based on overall ED experience. In our judgment, we believe it is reasonable to assume that no more than one out of every two super-saver trips will be modified or canceled. Accordingly, extended trips using non-contract carriers may be approved if the penalty does not exceed 150 percent of the overall trip savings.\\nIn order for a super-saver fare to be used, the following must hold true:\\n• the super-saver fare is the lower cost fare;\\n• the fare is available to the general public, and is not a “me too” fare; the\\n“me too” fare is a companion type fare. For example: the airlines are offering a special promotion where one traveler purchases a ticket for a certain price and the second traveler purchases a ticket for a penny;\\n• use of the fare will lower the overall trip cost; and\\n• the penalty the non-contract carrier may impose will not exceed 150\\npercent of the expected savings.\\nIt is very important that cancellation of super-saver fares be kept to a minimum if savings are to be realized. The EXO must approve requests of this nature and maintain records for review by OCFO. These records must show the cost comparison and reflect penalty fees incurred.\\nBecause of various legal considerations, the traveler must initiate requests for extended stay to take advantage of super-saver fares. Under these circumstances, it is assumed that no overtime pay or other compensation will be paid to the employee, except for additional per diem when travel dates are extended to achieve overall trip savings.'"

    "ex = 'B. Selecting a Mode of Transportation\\nModes of Transportation\\nTravelers should use the most direct or usually traveled route. Additional transportation costs incurred by an employee who elects for personal reasons to travel by an indirect route are the employee\\'s responsibility. (See Chapter IV; Per Diem, Section D, Interruptions to Per Diem Entitlement, for additional information.)\\nED travelers are required by law to use the most expeditious and cost- efficient means of transportation when on official travel. Usually, this will be a common carrier. Travelers must:\\n(a) Limit authorization and payment of transportation expenses to those expenses that result in the greatest advantage to the Government; and\\n(b) Ensure that travel is by the most expeditious means practicable.\\nAirlines are normally used for long distance travel since they usually result in the lowest overall cost. (Please note: Travelers must use city- pair fares and government contract carriers to accomplish their mission unless prior approval and justification have been given for non- contract use.)\\nWhen travelers have multiple (local) airport choices, travelers will need to request approval to fly from the higher cost airport if the total airfare cost differential exceeds $250. This approval must be obtained in advance of the trip from the traveler’s respective Principal Officer. If the cost is less than $250, no Principal Officer approval is required.\\nIn addition, travelers can fly direct non-stop contract carrier service in lieu of connecting contract carrier flights provided that the cost differential does not exceed $250. Approval of requests exceeding the $250 threshold must be obtained in advance of the trip from the traveler’s respective Principal Officer. If the cost is less than $250, no Principal Officer approval is required.\\nOther means of transportation, such as bus, train, or use of privately owned vehicles (POVs) and the payment of mileage, may be authorized if it is determined to be advantageous and economical to ED. When the use of a POV results in trip costs that are in excess of the common carrier cost for the same trip, reimbursement and compensatory time calculations are limited to the reconstructed common carrier cost of the trip.\\nAir Carriers (FTR §301-10)\\nUse of Government Contract Fares\\nThe Federal Government maintains contracts with air common carriers to provide discounted fares between selected pairs of cities (City-Pair Fares) and when they are available, the City-Pair Fares must be used.\\n(General Rule)\\nFailure to use available contract fares is a violation of Federal contracts and may leave the Government liable for damages for breach of contract.\\nExceptions to the Rule\\nIf a non-contract carrier is used on a city-pair route, one of the following travel conditions must be certified on the Travel Authorization and approved by the travel approving official:\\n• Airline seating capacity on any scheduled flight of the contract carrier is not available in sufficient time to accomplish the purpose of travel.\\n• The use of the contract carrier’s flight would require additional overnight lodging.\\n• The scheduled flight of the contract carrier is not compatible with ED policies and practices regarding travel during scheduled work hours. (Departure requires leaving before 6:30 a.m. or arriving after 6:30 p.m.)\\n• Exigency or other requirements of the mission necessitate the use of another carrier or mode of transportation.\\n• On the basis of a comparison of total costs for each individual trip, the use of a “Y” (Coach) or “S” (discounted) class fare (not to be confused with “TDG” (regular base fare) or other promotional fares) is less than the contract fare at the time the reservation is made, considering such factors as actual transportation costs, penalties for not using a contract fare, subsistence, allowable overtime, or lost productive time.\\nIf a contract fare is unavailable, travelers are expected to seek the most economical fares and should make reservations as far in advance as possible, inquiring if any discount fares are available.\\nUse of Non-Contract Fares\\nAn analysis is required to determine if the use of non-contract fares is permissible on an intended trip. For example, if a contracted city-pair fare is available for the intended travel sectors, then that fare must be used. If a city-pair fare exists but is not available (or if a city-pair fare does not exist), then a non-contract fare may be used if the use of a non-contract fare is advantageous to ED and an exception condition stated in Chapter II, Travel Authorizations, of this Handbook, is satisfied. Analysis may be required to determine if the use of a non-contract fare would provide cost savings to ED. The analysis may include estimating costs based on non-contract “Y” or “S” class fares for the trip and comparing it with the contract fare at the time of making the reservation. Other costs such as actual transportation costs, penalties, subsistence, allowable overtime, lost productive time, etc., resulting from the use of a non-contract carrier, should also be taken into consideration. The non-contract fare may be used if a city-pare fare is unavailable and if the use of a non-contract fare is cost effective for ED. The use of non-contract fares must be specifically authorized and approved by the EXO before obtaining transportation tickets. Cost savings to ED result from overall annual contracts signed with common carriers and not through isolated trips using a non-contract fare that is cheaper than the contract fare.'"

       " \"Preparation of Travel Authorization\\nEach trip that an employee intends to take must have a travel authorization. A single travel authorization may contain multiple destinations as long as a single departure and return to the traveler's official duty station or authorized point occurs. Authorizations and payment of transportation expenses are limited to those expenses that result in the greatest advantage to the government (e.g. the costs that would be incurred for roundtrip travel between the official duty station and the TDY site). All travel authorizations must be created using ED’s electronic travel system. Please refer to E2 End User Manual, the electronic travel system end-user guide, for assistance. Note: ED has implemented an electronic travel system. Printed copies of completed travel authorizations are not an ED requirement. Employees may choose to print completed authorizations to carry with them for TDY assignments. Printed authorizations do not have to become part of the retained travel documentation.\\nInformation Required\\nThe following is required to prepare a Travel Authorization:\\n• Traveler’s Name and ID Number;\\n• Itinerary;\\n• Purpose of Travel;\\n• Estimated Costs;\\n• Accounting Data;\\n• Special Authorizations; and\\nApproval Stamp.\\nAssignment of Travel Authorization\\nThe Travel Authorization Number is generated automatically in the electronic travel system. The first two positions of the travel authorization number designate the Principal Office organizational code and are followed by a sequential number (e.g., EL0000...).\\nCost Estimation\\nTravelers must estimate total costs of the trip for obligation purposes. Estimated costs should include:\\n• Per diem, reduced, conference or actual subsistence lodging rates;\\n• Transportation costs through the use of a contracted common carrier; and\\nOther reimbursable costs (i.e. taxis, phone calls, etc.).\\nAccounting Classification Identification\\nThe traveler or the traveler’s Principal Office must assign the\\nappropriate accounting data for obligating the funds.\\nEmergency Travel Procedures\\nThere may be a need for emergency travel where authorizations have not been created and/or certified in the electronic travel system. Since the Travel Management Center (TMC) requires a travel authorization prior to the issuance of airline tickets, Executive Offices have established emergency travel procedures to manually create (verbal) authorizations for travelers who are unable to generate a system authorization in sufficient time prior to departure. Upon returning from the trip, the traveler will be required to complete the electronic authorization, referencing the emergency TA number in the Remarks Section. The electronic travel authorization must be completely routed (certified) prior to creating and processing a voucher. The traveler should contact the Principal Office's Executive Office for further details on this process.\\nSpecific Authorization\\nWhen applicable, the following activities or expenditures must be specifically authorized in the Travel Authorization:\\n• Annual leave of 8 hours or more while in travel status;\\n• Auto rentals under GSA contract;\\n• Commercial car rentals;*\\n• Use of non-contract airline carrier;*\\n• Use of GSA auto;\\n• Travel by privately-owned vehicle (POV) in lieu of Common\\nCarrier;*\\n• Foreign travel;*\\n• First class accommodations;*\\n• Use of taxis;\\n• Pre-employment interview travel;\\n• Laundry on trips of 4 consecutive nights of lodging or more;\\n• Actual subsistence;*\\n• Acceptance of payment from a non-Federal source for travel\\nexpenses (In-kind travel);*\\n• Use of a foreign air carrier;\\n• Use of reduced fares for group or charter arrangements;\\n• Use of extra-fare train service;*\\n• Travel by ship;\\n• Use of a Government aircraft;\\n• Payment of a reduced per diem rate;\\n• Travel expenses related to emergency travel;\\n• Transportation expenses related to threatened law\\nenforcement/investigative employees and members of their\\nfamilies; or\\nTravel expenses related to attendance at a conference.\\n\": [('Can one travel authorization have multiple destinations?\\n',\n",

TMCs must be used to secure lodgings, rental cars, and purchase common carrier tickets for all official ED travel. A processing fee is charged for each ticketed transaction including cancellations that occur after a ticket has been issued. Travel reservations should be made via the TMC’s on-line booking engine, unless unusual circumstances prevent the use of on-line booking.\\nIf a traveler does not meet one of the exceptions listed below, and books outside of the TMC, the traveler is responsible for any additional costs resulting from failure to use the TMC. Prior approval from the Executive Officer (EXO) must be received before securing common carrier reservations outside of the TMC.\\nExceptions to using the TMC\\n• The primary reason travelers are required to use a TMC to book their lodging reservations is to ensure that the lodging property meets the Hotel/Motel Fire Safety Act. All lodging properties participating in the FedRooms Program must meet the Hotel/Motel Fire Safety Act. Therefore, a Federal traveler choosing to stay at one of these lodging properties may make the reservations directly with the lodging property, instead of using the TMC.\\n• TMCs can only reserve rooms at lodging properties that are in their system. If a lodging property is not listed in the TMC’s system, the traveler can make that lodging reservation outside of the TMC, as long as the lodging property is in compliance with the Hotel/Motel Fire Safety Act.\\n• TMCs cannot book lodging reservations for employees who are attending conferences/training where rooms have been blocked off by a third party other than the TMC. In these cases, the traveler would need to book the reservation outside the TMC.\\nIn some cases, the TMC’s on-line booking systems can only book car rental reservations at airport locations. If a traveler needs to make car rental reservations at other than an airport location, the traveler can either call the TMC to make the reservation or call the car rental company directly.\\nServices Provided\\nTMCs provide a wide range of travel services, including:\\n• Reservations and ticketing for travel via common carriers (air, rail, bus, steamship);\\n• Reservations for rental cars;\\n• Hotel/motel reservations and arrangements for conference\\nfacilities;\\n• Email notification of electronic common carrier tickets;\\n• Periodic management reports on travel activity;\\nPoint of contact for ED officials when problems arise; and • Offers on Supersaver/Penalty fares.       \\nUse of Other Travel Agencies\\nNo other travel agency may be used to purchase travel services for official government travel. Using travel agents other than the established TMC for ED is a violation of the TMC’s contract with the Federal Government and may subject the Government to a suit for damages for breach of contract. Use of other means may also result in a claim for reimbursement being denied. Only emergency situations allow for the purchase of tickets directly from a common carrier.\\nA traveler should immediately contact the TMC once he/she has notification of a trip cancellation. If reservations are cancelled before a ticket is issued there will be no fees charged. If reservations are cancelled after a ticket has been issued, the ticket issuing fee will be charged.\\nE-Ticket vs. Paper Ticket\\nED encourages the use of E-tickets rather than paper tickets.

       " \"B. Selecting a Mode of Transportation\\nModes of Transportation\\nTravelers should use the most direct or usually traveled route. Additional transportation costs incurred by an employee who elects for personal reasons to travel by an indirect route are the employee's responsibility. (See Chapter IV; Per Diem, Section D, Interruptions to Per Diem Entitlement, for additional information.)\\nED travelers are required by law to use the most expeditious and cost- efficient means of transportation when on official travel. Usually, this will be a common carrier. Travelers must:\\n(a) Limit authorization and payment of transportation expenses to those expenses that result in the greatest advantage to the Government; and\\n(b) Ensure that travel is by the most expeditious means practicable.\\nAirlines are normally used for long distance travel since they usually result in the lowest overall cost. (Please note: Travelers must use city- pair fares and government contract carriers to accomplish their mission unless prior approval and justification have been given for non- contract use.)\\nWhen travelers have multiple (local) airport choices, travelers will need to request approval to fly from the higher cost airport if the total airfare cost differential exceeds $250. This approval must be obtained in advance of the trip from the traveler’s respective Principal Officer. If the cost is less than $250, no Principal Officer approval is required.\\nIn addition, travelers can fly direct non-stop contract carrier service in lieu of connecting contract carrier flights provided that the cost differential does not exceed $250. Approval of requests exceeding the $250 threshold must be obtained in advance of the trip from the traveler’s respective Principal Officer. If the cost is less than $250, no Principal Officer approval is required.\\nOther means of transportation, such as bus, train, or use of privately owned vehicles (POVs) and the payment of mileage, may be authorized if it is determined to be advantageous and economical to ED. When the use of a POV results in trip costs that are in excess of the common carrier cost for the same trip, reimbursement and compensatory time calculations are limited to the reconstructed common carrier cost of the trip.\\nAir Carriers (FTR §301-10)\\nUse of Government Contract Fares\\nThe Federal Government maintains contracts with air common carriers to provide discounted fares between selected pairs of cities (City-Pair Fares) and when they are available, the City-Pair Fares must be used.\\n(General Rule)\\nFailure to use available contract fares is a violation of Federal contracts and may leave the Government liable for damages for breach of contract.\\nExceptions to the Rule\\nIf a non-contract carrier is used on a city-pair route, one of the following travel conditions must be certified on the Travel Authorization and approved by the travel approving official:\\n• Airline seating capacity on any scheduled flight of the contract carrier is not available in sufficient time to accomplish the purpose of travel.\\n• The use of the contract carrier’s flight would require additional overnight lodging.\\n• The scheduled flight of the contract carrier is not compatible with ED policies and practices regarding travel during scheduled work hours. (Departure requires leaving before 6:30 a.m. or arriving after 6:30 p.m.)\\n• Exigency or other requirements of the mission necessitate the use of another carrier or mode of transportation.\\n• On the basis of a comparison of total costs for each individual trip, the use of a “Y” (Coach) or “S” (discounted) class fare (not to be confused with “TDG” (regular base fare) or other promotional fares) is less than the contract fare at the time the reservation is made, considering such factors as actual transportation costs, penalties for not using a contract fare, subsistence, allowable overtime, or lost productive time.\\nIf a contract fare is unavailable, travelers are expected to seek the most economical fares and should make reservations as far in advance as possible, inquiring if any discount fares are available.\\nUse of Non-Contract Fares\\nAn analysis is required to determine if the use of non-contract fares is permissible on an intended trip. For example, if a contracted city-pair fare is available for the intended travel sectors, then that fare must be used. If a city-pair fare exists but is not available (or if a city-pair fare does not exist), then a non-contract fare may be used if the use of a non-contract fare is advantageous to ED and an exception condition stated in Chapter II, Travel Authorizations, of this Handbook, is satisfied. Analysis may be required to determine if the use of a non-contract fare would provide cost savings to ED. The analysis may include estimating costs based on non-contract “Y” or “S” class fares for the trip and comparing it with the contract fare at the time of making the reservation. Other costs such as actual transportation costs, penalties, subsistence, allowable overtime, lost productive time, etc., resulting from the use of a non-contract carrier, should also be taken into consideration. The non-contract fare may be used if a city-pare fare is unavailable and if the use of a non-contract fare is cost effective for ED. The use of non-contract fares must be specifically authorized and approved by the EXO before obtaining transportation tickets. Cost savings to ED result from overall annual contracts signed with common carriers and not through isolated trips using a non-contract fare that is cheaper than the contract fare.\\n\": [('What are some things that the traveler should keep in mind before selecting mode of transportation?\\n',\n",
